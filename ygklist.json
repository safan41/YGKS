Mount Erebus sits on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ross Island</span></b>. It took its name from the primordial personification of darkness in Greek mythology. The northeast slope of Mount Erebus is known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cFang Ridge,\u201d</span></b> and the volcano\u2019s underground magma produces unique pieces of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">feldspar</span></b> known as \u201cErebus crystals.\u201d In 1979 an Air New Zealand jet crashed into the side of Mount Erebus, killing 257 people.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Mount Etna</span></b> is a stratovolcano in eastern <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sicily</span></b> that plays a significant role in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ancient Greek myths</span></b>. Zeus trapped the monster <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Typhon</span></b> under Mount Etna, and the volcano is also the site of Hephaestus\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">forges</span></b>. Mount Etna overlooks the Sicilian town of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Catania</span></b>. It most recently erupted in 2015. Earlier eruptions occurred in 1928 (destroying the village of Mascali) and in 1669, after which the volcano was thought to have gone dormant. There is a large depression on the side of Mount Etna known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Valle del Bove</span></b>, or \u201cValley of the Ox.\u201d</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Mount Fuji</span></b>, a stratovolcano on the island of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Honshu</span></b>, is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Japan</span></b>\u2019s tallest mountain.

The name \u201cKilauea\u201d means \u201cspewing\u201d or \u201cspreading\u201d in the Hawaiian language. In Hawaiian mythology, the volcano is the home of the fire goddess <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pele</span></b>. The three primary craters of Kilauea are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu</span></b> Crater, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pu\u02bbu</span></b> Crater, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pu\u02bbu \u02bbO\u02bbo</span></b> Crater. In addition, part of the volcano is covered by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ka\u02bbu Desert</span></b>, a plain of dried lava and volcanic ash.

Prior to its massive <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">1883 eruption</span></b>, there were three separate volcanic peaks: <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Perboewatan</span></b> (completely destroyed by the eruption), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rakata</span></b> (extant), and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Danan</span></b> (almost completely destroyed). The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa killed more than 35,000 people and is believed to have produced the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">loudest sound ever</span></b>. Krakatoa is one of the largest volcanoes in the Pacific <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ring of Fire</span></b>.

It should not be confused with Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano that is the tallest mountain in Hawaii. Both Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa are taller than Mount Everest when measuring from base-to-summit rather than from sea level. Along with Kilauea, Mauna Loa forms the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park</span></b>, which was established in 1916 by Woodrow Wilson. When Mauna Loa erupted in 1942, four months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government gagged the press from reporting on the eruption.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Mount Pinatubo</span></b> is a stratovolcano in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zambales Mountains</span></b> on the eastern coast of the island of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Luzon</span></b> in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Philippines</span></b>. In the aftermath of its <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">1991 eruption</span></b>, the global temperature briefly decreased by almost a full degree Fahrenheit due to the ejection of aerosols and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sulfuric acid</span></b>. That eruption was ten times more powerful than the 1980 eruption of Mount Saint Helens; it killed at least 800 people and forced the evacuation of some 20,000 people. In its aftermath, monsoon rains created <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lake Pinatubo</span></b> in the resulting crater. In 2010, the indigenous <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aeta people</span></b> were formally granted domain over the volcano.</li>",

It is located about 50 miles southeast of Seattle. The three principal peaks of Mount Rainier are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Columbia Crest</span></b> (the tallest), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Point Success</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Liberty Cap</span></b>; the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Little Tahoma Peak</span></b> is a remnant of an older, much larger Mount Rainier that has since eroded away. Mount Rainier has not erupted since the mid-to-late nineteenth century. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nisqually Glacier</span></b>, on Mount Rainier\u2019s southwestern slope, is used to track climate change. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emmons Glacier</span></b> on Mount Rainier is the largest glacier by area in the contiguous U.S., while the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Carbon Glacier</span></b> is the largest by volume. The entirety of Mount Rainier is in Mount Rainier National Park, the fifth national park established in the U.S.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Mount Saint Helens</span></b> is another stratovolcano in the Cascades of Washington state. It is about 100 miles south of Seattle and about 50 miles north of Portland. It last <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">erupted in May 1980</span></b>, killing 57 people in the most devastating volcanic eruption in U.S. history. Perhaps the most famous casualty of that eruption was an innkeeper named <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Harry Truman</span></b> (no relation to the president of the same name) who refused to evacuate from the mountain. Because of an avalanche of volcanic debris during that eruption, Mount Saint Helens lost about 1300 feet in height; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">lahars</span></b> (mudflows of pyroclastic material) reached all the way to the Columbia River. The volcano is surrounded by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Gifford Pinchot National Forest</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Mount Vesuvius</span></b> is a stratovolcano on the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Gulf of Naples</span></b> in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Campania</span></b> in south-central Italy. Mount Vesuvius, which last erupted in 1944, is the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">only active volcano on mainland Europe</span></b>. The most notable eruption of Mount Vesuvius was in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">AD\u00a079</span></b> when it buried the Roman cities of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pompeii</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Herculaneum</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stabiae</span></b>. The only surviving eyewitness accounts of that eruption are a pair of letters written by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pliny the Younger</span></b> to Tacitus. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">1908 Summer Olympics</span></b> were relocated from Rome to London after a surprise eruption of Mount Vesuvius.</li>"

The two kings were also joined by five annually elected <i class=\"ygk-term\">ephors</i>, who had broad executive powers.  Sparta beat its rival Athens in the Peloponnesian War in the late 5th century BC, but lost its position as the leading military power in all of Greece to Thebes in 371\u00a0BC.\r\n\t</li>",

After the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">English Civil War</span></b>, under the leadership of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Oliver Cromwell</span></b>, Puritans enjoyed a brief period of power in England, during which time they <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">closed theaters</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">limited sports</span></b>, and instituted harsh <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">penalties for breaking the Sabbath</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Levellers</span></b> and <b><span class=\"label\">Diggers</span></b> (mid-17th century) During the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">English Civil War</span></b>, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">opponents of the monarchy</span></b> included holders of a wide range of political beliefs. Those <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">politicians</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">soldiers</span></b> who wanted to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">extend suffrage</span></b> and establish <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">equality before the law</span></b> were known as Levellers, a pejorative term probably referring to the fact that they wanted all people to live on a common level. Some radicals, inspired by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Book of Acts</span></b>, went even further in attempting to establish <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">egalitarianism in the English countryside</span></b> by trying to farm on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">common land</span></b>. Because they dug up this land, they became known as Diggers, but preferred to call themselves the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cTrue Levellers.\u201d</span></b> The Levellers, who were less radical than the Diggers, had considerably more influence on English politics. Several Leveller leaders were invited to debate the main leaders of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">New Model Army</span></b> during the 1647 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Putney Debates</span></b> about the formation of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">new English constitution</span></b>. In the end, both the Levellers and the Diggers were suppressed by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Oliver Cromwell</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Henry Ireton</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Luddites</span></b> (early 19th century) As the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Industrial Revolution</span></b> accelerated in the early 19th century, many skilled <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">textile workers</span></b> were replaced by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unskilled laborers</span></b> who could use newly invented machines. The most vocal opponents of textile mechanization were known as Luddites, a term said to have derived from the surname of a youth named <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ned Ludd</span></b>, who broke two <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">stocking frames</span></b> in 1779. Between 1811 and 1813, organized groups of Luddites clashed with the British military at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mills</span></b> in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nottinghamshire</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Yorkshire</span></b>. In response, Parliament passed the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Frame Breaking Act</span></b>, which made <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">industrial sabotage</span></b> a capital crime. While the Luddites were suppressed relatively quickly, the perpetrators of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Swing Riots</span></b> in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kent</span></b> in 1830 employed similar tactics by demolishing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">threshing machines</span></b> to protest the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mechanization of agriculture</span></b>. Today, the term \u201cLuddite\u201d refers more generally to anybody who is uncomfortable with technology.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Chartists</span></b> (19th century) Another <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">working-class</span></b> reform movement in industrial England was the Chartist movement, so named because it advocated the adoption of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">People\u2019s Charter of 1838</span></b>. The Charter was written by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">six members of Parliament and six workers</span></b>. It called for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">democratization</span></b> of the political system by instituting <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">universal suffrage</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">secret ballots</span></b>, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">abolition of property qualifications</span></b> to stand for election, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">salaries for members of Parliament</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">constituencies of equal size</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">annual parliamentary elections</span></b>. The Chartist movement inspired several mass <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">rallies</span></b>, peaking in size in 1848 as the rest of Europe was swept up in revolution. The Chartist movement did not directly inspire any political reforms, but Parliament gradually granted five of the six demands of the Charter (the demand for annual elections was the only one never implemented).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Anti-Corn Law League</span></b> (early-mid 19th century) From 1838 to 1846, the leading organization agitating for repeal of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Corn Laws</span></b> was the Anti-Corn Law League. The Corn Laws were a series of laws that imposed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tariffs on imported grain</span></b> (\u201ccorn\u201d was at that time a generic term for types of grain that require grinding, including <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">wheat</span></b>), which kept grain prices high to benefit English landowners. The founders of the Anti-Corn Law League, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Richard Cobden</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Bright</span></b>, argued that importing grain would <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">lower food prices</span></b> for workers and thus stimulate the British economy. The Corn Laws were eventually repealed in 1846 under the leadership of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Conservative Prime Minister Robert Peel</span></b>, a decision hastened by the start of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Irish Potato Famine</span></b> the previous year. The repeal of the Corn Laws ushered in an era of support for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">free trade</span></b> that continues to this day. Another legacy of opposition to the Corn Laws was the founding of the weekly publication <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Economist</i> in 1843 to promote repeal of trade restrictions.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Reform League</span></b>(mid-late 19th century) A variety of organizations, including the Reform League, sprung up in 1865 to promote <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">universal suffrage</span></b> in the United Kingdom. Universal suffrage had been one of the demands of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chartist Movement</span></b>, but Parliament had not enacted it. The Reform League staged <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mass meetings</span></b> to influence parliamentary proceedings, including a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">rally in Hyde Park</span></b> in 1866 that forced the resignation of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Spencer Walpole</span></b> as Home Secretary. The Reform League\u2019s platform was eventually enacted in 1867, during <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Benjamin Disraeli</span></b>\u2019s prime ministry. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Second Reform Act of 1867</span></b> enfranchised urban working-class males in England and Wales (further bills enfranchised Scotland and Ireland the following year).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Fabian Society</span></b> (1884\u2013present) One of the most influential <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">intellectual communities</span></b> in British history was the Fabian Society, an organization founded in 1884 to promote the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gradual adoption of socialism</span></b>. The society was named for the Roman general <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Fabius Maximus</span></b>, who avoided fighting pitched battles against <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hannibal</span></b> and instead won a gradual <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">war of attrition</span></b>. The Fabian Society pressed for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">progressive economic measures</span></b> that went far <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">beyond the platform of the Liberal Party</span></b>, including a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">minimum wage</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">universal health care</span></b>. Prominent members of the Fabian Society included <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George Bernard Shaw</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">H.\u00a0G. Wells</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Virginia Woolf</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ramsay MacDonald</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sidney and Beatrice Webb</span></b>. In 1900, many members of the Fabian Society founded the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Labour Party</span></b>, a socialist rival to the two major parties, which eventually came to power in 1924 under <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ramsay MacDonald</span></b>. Today, the Fabian Society continues to exist as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">left-wing think tank</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Suffragettes</span></b> (early 20th century) In the early 20th century, many different groups began to clamor for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">voting rights to be extended to women</span></b>. The most militant advocates for women\u2019s suffrage became known as Suffragettes. This term is especially associated with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emmeline Pankhurst</span></b> and her organization, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Women\u2019s Social and Political Union</span></b>. In the 1910s, many Suffragettes adopted <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">militant tactics</span></b> to draw attention to their cause, including <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emily Davison</span></b>\u2019s protest at the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Epsom Derby</span></b> in 1913 when she was trampled and killed by the King\u2019s horse, a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">slashing attack</span></b> by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mary Richardson</span></b> on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Diego Vel\u00e1zquez</span></b>\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Rokeby Venus</i> in 1914, and the 1914 bombing of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Coronation Chair</span></b> inside <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Westminster Abbey</span></b>. Many Suffragettes who were arrested went on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">hunger strikes</span></b>, leading the government of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Herbert Asquith</span></b> to pass the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cat and Mouse Act</span></b>, which allowed hunger strikers to be <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">released and subsequently re-arrested</span></b>. In 1918, Parliament finally extended voting rights to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">women over the age of 30 who met property qualifications</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">National Union of Mineworkers</span></b> (late 20th century) This list would not be complete without some mention of the organizations that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">opposed the conservative economic measures imposed by the government of Margaret Thatcher</span></b> in the 1980s. One conflict that deserves particular attention is the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">strike</span></b> led by the National Union of Mineworkers in 1984 and 1985 under the leadership of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Arthur Scargill</span></b>. The entire British <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">coal industry</span></b> had been <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">nationalized</span></b> by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Clement Attlee</span></b>\u2019s Labour government in 1947. In 1984, the Thatcher government announced a plan to close 20 coal mining pits as a way of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">reducing government subsidies</span></b> to the mines, which precipitated a strike. By March 1985, the Thatcher government had outlasted the strikers, effectively breaking the power of one of Britain\u2019s most powerful unions. The British coal industry was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">privatized</span></b> in 1994. Today, most of Britain\u2019s coal is imported, and the former mining areas have some of the highest <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unemployment</span></b> rates in the country.</li>"

The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Marco Polo Bridge Incident</span></b> of 1937 resulted in open war between Japan and China. Japanese forces committed notorious <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">atrocities</span></b> during the invasion of China, including the 1937 massacres known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rape of Nanking</span></b>.

Allied troops were driven back toward Singapore, Britain\u2019s major base in the Far East. Reinforcements from Britain and Australia arrived too late to repair the situation, and British general <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Arthur Percival</span></b> was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">forced to surrender</span></b> in February 1942. The loss of Singapore stunned the British Empire.

President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s address to Congress described December\u00a07 as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cdate which will live in infamy.\u201d</span></b>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Battle of Bataan</span></b> (January to May\u00a01942):\n\t\t\tImmediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese bombers struck the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Philippine island Luzon</span></b>, forcing the Americans to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">retreat</span></b> to the Bataan Peninsula, where they held out for four months. General Douglas MacArthur vowed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cI shall return\u201d</span></b> before <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">evacuating to Australia</span></b> and leaving command to Jonathan Wainwright, who retreated to the island of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Corregidor</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">surrendered</span></b> on May\u00a06.  The prisoners from Bataan were sent on a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cdeath march\u201d</span></b> 80 miles to San Fernando with minimal food, water, and medical supplies; those that fell behind were beaten.  Japanese <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">General Masaharu Homma</span></b> was executed in 1946 for his role in the war crime.\n\t\t</li>\n<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Fall of Singapore</span></b> (February 1942):\n\t\t\tJapan\u2019s offensive in southeast Asia also struck at the British Empire. Japanese aircraft sank the British battleship <i class=\"ygk-term\">Prince of Wales</i> and drove obsolete British aircraft from the skies over the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Malay Peninsula</span></b>. Allied troops were driven back toward Singapore, Britain\u2019s major base in the Far East. Reinforcements from Britain and Australia arrived too late to repair the situation, and British general <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Arthur Percival</span></b> was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">forced to surrender</span></b> in February 1942. The loss of Singapore stunned the British Empire. Many <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Indian prisoners captured at Singapore switched sides</span></b> to fight for the Japanese; British and Australian <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">POWs labored in terrible conditions</span></b> on the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Siam-Burma railway</span></b> depicted in the novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Bridge over the River Kwai</i>.\n\t\t</li>\n<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Battle of the Coral Sea</span></b> (May 1942):\n\t\t\tThe Battle of the Coral Sea resulted from Japanese ambitions to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">invade Port Moresby</span></b>, an Allied base in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">New Guinea</span></b>.  <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Frank Jack Fletcher</span></b>\u2019s American fleet <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">damaged two Japanese aircraft carriers</span></b>, Shokaku and Zuikaku. The U.S. Navy\u2019s major loss was the carrier <i class=\"ygk-term\">Lexington</i>. The battle, a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tactical draw</span></b>, prevented the Japanese from attacking Port Moresby. It is notable for being the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">first naval battle fought entirely by aircraft</span></b> \u2014 neither fleet was ever in visual range of the other\u2019s ships.\n\t\t</li>\n<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Battle of Midway</span></b> (June 1942):\n\t\t\tMidway is considered the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">turning point of World War\u00a0II in the Pacific</span></b>.  Japanese <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Admiral Yamamoto</span></b> launched attacks on both Midway Island \u2014 an atoll northwest of Hawaii \u2014 and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aleutian Islands</span></b> in Alaska, but the Americans had <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">broken the Japanese naval code</span></b> and were forewarned.  <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Admiral Chester W. Nimitz</span></b>\u2019s American fleet lost the aircraft carrier <i class=\"ygk-term\">Yorktown</i>, but American dive-bombers <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">destroyed four Japanese carriers</span></b>: <i>Soryu</i>, <i>Akagi</i>, <i>Kaga</i>, and <i>Hiryu</i>. The loss of four irreplaceable aircraft carriers and the death of the best-trained Japanese pilots <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">crippled Japanese naval aviation</span></b> for the duration of the war.\n\t\t</li>\n<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Guadalcanal Campaign</span></b> (August\u00a01942 to February\u00a01943):\n\t\t\tThis first Allied counteroffensive in the Pacific targeted Guadalcanal, an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">island in the Solomons</span></b>, to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">secure communications</span></b> between the U.S. Pacific coast and Australia. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cOperation Watchtower\u201d</span></b> was the codename for the initial U.S. Marine landings, which <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">secured an airbase at Henderson Field</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">held off a Japanese counterattack on Edson\u2019s Ridge</span></b>. The naval <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">battle of Savo Island</span></b> took place between American ships and Japanese forces (the so-called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cTokyo Express\u201d</span></b>) trying to resupply troops on Guadalcanal. By early 1943, Allied dominance of the seas and skies around Guadalcanal forced Japan to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">withdraw</span></b> its remaining troops.\n\t\t</li>\n<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Battle of Leyte Gulf</span></b> (October 1944):\n\t\t\tThe American landings on the island of Leyte in the fall of 1944 fulfilled <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Douglas MacArthur\u2019s promise to return to the Philippines</span></b>. Most of the Imperial Japanese Navy\u2019s remaining strength emerged to challenge the Allied landing, setting up <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">one of the largest naval battles in world history</span></b>. American admiral <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">William \u201cBull\u201d Halsey</span></b> was criticized for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">poorly-coordinated response to the Japanese attack</span></b>. Nevertheless, American ships, aircraft, and submarines were able to destroy more than two dozen Japanese vessels, including the giant battleship <i>Musashi</i>. The Japanese position was by now so desperate that Japan began the practice of suicidal <i class=\"ygk-term\">kamikaze</i> attacks on Allied naval vessels.\n\t\t</li>\n<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Battle of Iwo Jima</span></b> (February to March\u00a01945):\n\t\t\tIwo Jima is an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">isolated volcanic island between the Marianas and Honshu</span></b>; early in 1945 it was strategically important as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">base for American air attacks on the Japanese home islands</span></b>. The defenders were led by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">General Tadamichi Kuribayashi</span></b>, who attempted to prolong the battle indefinitely by digging an elaborate <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">system of tunnels</span></b> to protect his troops. The U.S Marines who stormed the island starting in February 1945 sustained thousands of casualties. <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://www.iwojima.com/bond/lflage.gif\">Joe Rosenthal\u2019s photograph</a> of Marines raising the flag on Iwo\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mount Suribachi</span></b> is one of the best known images of the Second World War.\n\t\t</li>\n<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Battle of Okinawa</span></b> (April to June\u00a01945):\n\t\t\tCodenamed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Operation Iceberg</span></b>, the invasion of Okinawa was the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">last major ground battle in the Pacific theater</span></b> of World War\u00a0II. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kakazu Ridge</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Shuri Castle</span></b> were among the positions Japanese troops defended against U.S. Marine and Army units. Okinawa was the high point of Japanese <i class=\"ygk-term\">kamikaze</i> attacks; over 1,500 suicide missions were sent against the Allied invasion fleet. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">heavy casualties sustained by both sides</span></b> on Okinawa and the suicidal bravery of the Japanese military <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">encouraged American planners to use atomic weapons</span></b> on Hiroshima and Nagasaki instead of launching <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Operation Downfall</span></b>, the projected late-1945 conventional invasion of the Japanese home islands.\n\t\t</li>\n</ul>",

Archaeological excavations at the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ruins of Yin</span></b>, near the modern city of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Anyang</span></b>, uncovered the remains of a Chinese civilization from the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bronze Age</span></b>. Shang dynasty writings are found on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201coracle bones,\u201d</span></b> pieces of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ox bone</span></b> or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">turtle shell</span></b> that were heated to produce a pattern of cracks that supposedly foretold the future.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Zhou <b><span class=\"pg\">\u201cJoe\u201d</span></b> dynasty</span></b> (1046\u2013256\u00a0BC) were <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">chariot warriors</span></b> who overthrew the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Shang dynasty</span></b>. Although the Zhou ruled for nearly 800 years, during much of the time period real power lay in the hands of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">feudal lords</span></b>. The sacking of the Zhou capital by barbarians in 771\u00a0BC marks the beginning of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eastern Zhou</span></b> and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Spring and Autumn Period</span></b> (771\u00a0BC \u2013 476\u00a0BC). During the Spring and Autumn Period, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hundred Schools of Thought</span></b> (including <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Confucianism</span></b>) flourished, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sun Tzu</span></b> wrote his <i class=\"ygk-term\">Art of War</i>. The end of the Zhou era devolved into the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Warring States period</span></b> (476\u00a0BC \u2013 221\u00a0BC), during which power coalesced into <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">seven independent feudal states</span></b>. The state of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Qin</span></b> eventually grew powerful and efficient enough that it was able to defeat the other six states and complete the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unification of China</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Qin <b><span class=\"pg\">\u201cchin\u201d</span></b> dynasty</span></b> (221\u2013206\u00a0BC), despite its short duration, is usually considered the origin of many of the institutions of imperial China. The founding emperor, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Qin Shi Huangdi</span></b> (usually shorted as Qin Shi Huang), has gained an ill-deserved reputation in traditional Chinese historiography because he <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">destroyed many Confucian texts</span></b> in his infamous <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">book burning</span></b>. Qin Shi Huang also <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">standardized weight measurements</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unified the Chinese script</span></b>, and used <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">conscripts</span></b> to build the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Great Wall</span></b>. After his death, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">suicide of the crown prince</span></b> led to a period of incompetent rule and revolts that caused the collapse of the Qin dynasty.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Han dynasty</span></b> (206\u00a0BC \u2013 AD\u00a0220) is considered a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">golden age</span></b> of Chinese civilization; its influence was so great that the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">majority ethnic group</span></b> in China is still called the Han. Its founder, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Liu Bang</span></b> (later <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emperor Gaozu</span></b>), was born a peasant. Through resourceful recruitment of talented followers and strategic <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">violation of ceasefire</span></b> agreement with his rival <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Xiang Yu</span></b>, Liu Bang managed to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">reunite China</span></b> and established his capital at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chang\u2019an</span></b> (modern <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Xi\u2019an</span></b>). Instability in the early years of the Han dynasty was caused by the depredations of the nomadic <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Xiongnu</span></b>, a problem that was solved by its seventh emperor, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Wudi</span></b>. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emperor Wu</span></b>, considered one of the greatest rulers of China, began a war of conquest against the Xiongnu and greatly <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">expanded China\u2019s frontiers</span></b>. He also <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">formalized China\u2019s bureaucracy</span></b>, sent envoys like <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zhang Qian</span></b> to Central Asia, and established <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Confucianism</span></b> as the official state doctrine. Despite his success, his campaigns <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">drained the treasury</span></b> and his successors were unable to maintain the land he conquered. After a series of poor rulers, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Wang family</span></b> \u2014 who claimed legitimacy through wives of various emperors \u2014 and their leader <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Wang Mang</span></b> toppled the Han dynasty. Wang Mang established the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Xin</span></b> (meaning \u201cnew\u201d) dynasty and attempted to restore the ways of the Zhou dynasty, but he was unable to maintain power because of a catastrophic <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">changing of the course of the Yellow River</span></b>, which spawned <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">peasant protest movements</span></b> like the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Red Eyebrows</span></b>. Eventually, a scion of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Liu</span></b> family \u2014 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Liu Xiu</span></b> \u2014 restored the Han dynasty, moving the capital to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Luoyang</span></b> and establishing the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eastern Han</span></b>. Subsequent rebellions called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Yellow Turbans</span></b> and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Five Pecks of Rice</span></b> hastened the end of the Han dynasty.</li>",
                "<li>The short and turbulent <b><span class=\"label\">period of the Three Kingdoms</span></b> (AD\u00a0184\u2013280) has had an enormous cultural impact thanks to the classic Chinese novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>. After a period of disunion, the lands of the former Han dynasty coalesced into three kingdoms: <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cao Wei</span></b> north of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Yangtze</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eastern Wu</span></b> in the lower Yangtze, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Shu Han</span></b> in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sichuan</span></b> region. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Battle of Red Cliffs</span></b> (AD\u00a0208) was fought during this period.  Under the leadership of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sima family</span></b>, Cao Wei managed to defeat the other two kingdoms. The reunification was, however, short-lived. For the next four centuries, China went through a period known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Southern and Northern Dynasties</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Tang dynasty</span></b> (618\u2013907) is considered another <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">golden age</span></b> of Chinese culture: during the Tang period, important poets such as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Li\u00a0Bai</span></b> (or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Li\u00a0Po</span></b>) and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Du\u00a0Fu</span></b> lived, and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">printing press</span></b> was invented. The Tang dynasty reunited China after the collapse of the short-lived <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sui dynasty</span></b>, was ruled by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Li family</span></b>, and had its capital at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chang\u2019an</span></b> (modern day <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Xi\u2019an</span></b>). Its first ruler, like the founder of the Han Dynasty, used the title of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emperor Gaozu</span></b>. Gaozu was forced by his second son, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Li Shimin</span></b> (later <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emperor Taizong</span></b>), to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">abdicate</span></b> after Li Shimin <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">killed two of his brothers</span></b> in an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ambush</span></b>. Despite his bloody path to power, Taizong is considered to be one of the greatest rulers in Chinese history, subjugating much of what is now <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">western China</span></b> and parts of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">central Asia</span></b>. After his death, power came to be concentrated in the hands of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Empress\u00a0Wu</span></b>. Empress\u00a0Wu (or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Wu Zetian</span></b>) was the only woman to become emperor of China, and called her rule the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cSecond Zhou dynasty.\u201d</span></b> Wu was a notable supporter of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Buddhism</span></b> and promoted the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">imperial examination</span></b>, but succession troubles resulted in the premature end of her dynasty. During the reign of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emperor Xuanzong</span></b>, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">An\u00a0Lushan rebellion</span></b> (also called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">An\u00a0Shi rebellion</span></b>) wrecked the foundations of the Tang dynasty. Although it was suppressed, the An\u00a0Lushan rebellion concentrated power in the hands of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">regional military overlords</span></b>. The dynasty had a tumultuous end in 907 that marked the beginning of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Song dynasty</span></b> (960\u20131279) is known for its <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">devotion to cultural activities instead of warfare</span></b> and for the establishment of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Neo-Confucianism</span></b> as state doctrine, with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">imperial examination</span></b> as the primary way of recruiting talent.  It was also during the Song dynasty that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gunpowder</span></b> and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">compass</span></b> were discovered.  The Song dynasty, even in its early years, could not rule all of China proper and was forced to relinquish parts of northern China to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cbarbarian\u201d Liao dynasty</span></b>, paying <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tribute for peace</span></b>. Although like most dynasties, it began as the ventures of a military leader, its first ruler, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Taizu</span></b>, realized that his rival generals could take power from him. He then induced all his major commanders to retire, setting up the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dominance of the scholarly elite over the military elite</span></b> throughout the Song dynasty. This policy was continued by his successors. In the north, however, the Liao dynasty was eventually replaced by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">militaristic Jin dynasty</span></b>, who captured the Song capital, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kaifeng</span></b> along with two Emperors. The remnants of the court fled across the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Yangtze</span></b> and established the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Southern Song</span></b> with a new capital at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hangzhou</span></b>, maintaining peace with the Jin through annual tribute. This state of affairs was brought to an end after the Song dynasty aided the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mongols</span></b> in crushing the Jin, only to discover that they themselves were the next target. Despite the might of the Mongol war machine, the Song dynasty managed to repel major Mongol offensives for nearly 40\u00a0years, before it was finally defeated.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Yuan dynasty</span></b> (1271\u20131368) was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">short-lived</span></b> dynasty established by the invading <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mongols</span></b>, who destroyed the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jin</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Song states</span></b>. Its most notable ruler was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kublai Khan</span></b>, whose <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">invasions of Japan</span></b> were thwarted by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">typhoons</span></b> that the Japanese called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">kamikaze</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cdivine wind.\u201d</span></b> Yuan rulers were hostile to many Chinese institutions, and thus received minimal support from the Chinese elites. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Red Turban rebellion</span></b> of the 1350s marked the beginning of the end for the Yuan.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Ming dynasty</span></b> (1368\u20131644) was the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">last native dynasty</span></b> of China; its rulers came from the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zhu family</span></b>.  The use of the word \u201cchina\u201d to describe <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fine porcelain</span></b> originated from this period, as the Ming were well-known for producing high-quality porcelain. Its founding ruler, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zhu Yuanzhang</span></b> (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emperor Hongwu</span></b>), was a peasant leader of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Red Turbans</span></b> who helped expel the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mongol Yuan rulers</span></b> from China. He was succeeded by his grandson, who quickly lost power to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zhu\u00a0Di</span></b> (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emperor Yongle</span></b>). During the reign of the Yongle emperor, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">eunuch</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zheng\u00a0He</span></b> led <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">treasure fleets</span></b> on seven voyages to display Chinese greatness. Zhu\u00a0Di moved China\u2019s capital to Beijing. After his death, the Ming dynasty <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">banned maritime commerce</span></b>, which left the dynasty vulnerable to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pirates</span></b>. The Ming dynasty came to an end after the rebellion of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Li\u00a0Zicheng</span></b>, which was caused by inadequate government response to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">inflation</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">famine</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">floods</span></b>. Simultaneously, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Manchu people</span></b> \u2014 tributaries of the Ming from northeast China in what is now <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Manchuria</span></b> \u2014 marched on the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Great Wall</span></b>. The Manchus suppressed Li\u00a0Zicheng\u2019s revolt and took power in Beijing themselves.</li>",
                "<li>The invading Manchus established the <b><span class=\"label\">Qing <b><span class=\"pg\">cheeng</span></b> dynasty</span></b> (1644\u20131911), the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">last dynasty to rule imperial China</span></b>. An important institution of the Qing dynasty was the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">banner system</span></b>, which acted as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">guaranteed welfare</span></b> system for Manchus and gave them benefits in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">imperial examination</span></b> (positions were often duplicated, with one Han Chinese and one Manchu from the banners). The foundations of the Qing dynasty were established under its second ruler, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kangxi Emperor</span></b>, who put down the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Revolt of the Three Feudatories</span></b>. He is also famous for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kangxi dictionary</span></b>, which is known for popularizing the system of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chinese radicals</span></b>. During the last century of Qing rule, China was weakened both by foreign attacks (the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Opium Wars</span></b> against <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Britain</span></b>) and internal dissent (the devastating <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Taiping Rebellion</span></b> of 1850\u20131864). Attempts to modernize Qing rule (the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Self-Strengthening Movement</span></b> and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hundred Days\u2019 Reform</span></b> of 1898) proved inconclusive.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Fort Sumter</span></b> (April 12, 1861). Built on an island in 1829, the fort was one of three that the United States maintained in the harbor of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Charleston, South Carolina</span></b>. In order to claim true independence from the Union, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jefferson Davis</span></b> decided that the forts needed to be taken; a Confederate force under <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">P.\u00a0G.\u00a0T. Beauregard</span></b> ordered the small Union garrison, controlled by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Major Robert Anderson</span></b>, to surrender. Anderson refused, shots were fired, and the Union commander surrendered two days later with only one soldier killed. The Union made two unsuccessful attempts to recapture the fort with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ironclad ships</span></b> in 1863, but Confederate forces finally abandoned Sumter when they left Charleston in February 1865.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">First Bull Run (or First Manassas)</span></b> (July 21, 1861). Fought at a creek near Manassas, Virginia (30 miles west of Washington, D.C.), this was the first major showdown of the war. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">P.\u00a0G.\u00a0T. Beauregard</span></b> led an army against Union commander <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Irwin McDowell</span></b> and received reinforcements from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joseph Johnston</span></b>\u2019s troops (whom Union General Robert Patterson failed to detain). The Confederacy routed the Union when <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thomas Jackson</span></b>\u2019s brigade held the left line at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Henry House Hill</span></b>; this effort earned him the nickname <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cStonewall.\u201d</span></b> Congressmen and reporters, who had expected to watch a Union victory, fled in panic back to D.C.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Hampton Roads</span></b> (March 9, 1862). A channel in southeastern Virginia was the site of the first major fight between two <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ironclad ships</span></b>. The Confederates raised an old wooden boat, the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Merrimack</i>, and fit it with ten guns and iron armor plates. Renamed the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Virginia</i>, it was captained by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Franklin Buchanan</span></b>. The Union countered by constructing a large oval with a rotating gun, called the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Monitor</i> and piloted by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Worden</span></b>. The <i>Virginia</i> tore through Union wooden ships (the <i>Cumberland</i>, <i>Congress</i>, and <i>Minnesota</i>) but when the <i>Monitor</i> arrived, the two ironclads fought to a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">stalemate</span></b>; the Union thus maintained its <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">naval blockade</span></b> of the Confederacy. The South deliberately destroyed the <i>Virginia</i> two months later. The <i>Monitor</i> sank in a storm off Cape Hatteras in December 1862.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Shiloh (or Pittsburg Landing)</span></b> (April 6\u20137, 1862). This battle was named after a church in Pittsburg Landing, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tennessee</span></b> (100 miles southwest of Nashville). Confederate commander <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Albert Sidney Johnston</span></b> led a force north from Corinth, Mississippi. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ulysses S. Grant</span></b>, who had just captured Fort Donelson, brought five Union divisions to face him. At first, the South\u2019s surprise attack drove Union troops back, but Grant\u2019s soldiers held the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cHornets\u2019 Nest\u201d</span></b> for hours, killing Johnston in the process. P.\u00a0G.\u00a0T.

More than 13,000 Union and 10,000 Confederate soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured at Shiloh.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Peninsular Campaign</span></b> (March\u2013July 1862). Union commander <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George McClellan</span></b> devised this plan to capture the Confederate capital at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Richmond, Virginia</span></b> by sending 110,000 men up the peninsula between the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">York and James Rivers</span></b>. Advised of Northern maneuvers, Southern commander <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joseph Johnston</span></b> detached a force to defend the peninsula. He also sent a small unit (led by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stonewall Jackson</span></b>) that crushed Union reinforcements in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Shenandoah Valley</span></b>. After Johnston was wounded at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Seven Pines</span></b> (June 1), Davis replaced him with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert E. Lee</span></b>. Lee concentrated his force north of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chickahominy River</span></b>; in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Seven Days\u2019 Battles</span></b> (June 25\u00a0\u2013 July 1), the Confederates broke through Union defenses, leading to McClellan\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">retreat down the James</span></b> toward <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Harrison\u2019s Landing</span></b>, and the failure of the campaign.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Second Bull Run (or Second Manassas)</span></b> (August 29\u201330, 1862). This resounding victory by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert E. Lee</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stonewall Jackson</span></b> pushed Union forces back to Washington, D.C. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">President Abraham Lincoln</span></b> gathered forces in northern Virginia under <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">General John Pope</span></b>, who would protect the capital until <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George McClellan</span></b>\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Army of the Potomac</span></b> returned from the Peninsula Campaign. Lee maneuvered Jackson\u2019s troops behind those of Pope; Jackson detained Pope\u2019s men at Manassas while Lee sent James Longstreet to crush Pope\u2019s left flank. Pope\u2019s and McClellan\u2019s joint forces retreated to defend Washington, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ceding all of Virginia</span></b> to the Confederacy and marking a low point in the Union effort.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Antietam (or Sharpsburg)</span></b> (September 17, 1862). The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bloodiest single day</span></b> of the Civil War: 12,000 Union and 10,000 Confederate casualties. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert E. Lee</span></b> invaded Maryland, but a Union soldier <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">discovered Lee\u2019s battle plans</span></b> wrapped around three discarded cigars. After the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Battle of South Mountain</span></b> (September 14), Lee\u2019s forces retired toward Antietam Creek. Meanwhile, Stonewall Jackson\u2019s forces captured <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Harper\u2019s Ferry, Virginia</span></b>, and rushed north to rejoin Lee\u2019s main army. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George McClellan</span></b> had a substantial numerical superiority over Lee\u2019s Confederates, but failed to effectively coordinate his army\u2019s attacks. Antietam thus was actually a series of several distinct clashes, near the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dunker Church</span></b>, along the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bloody Lane</span></b>, and around <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Burnside\u2019s Bridge</span></b>. After the battle\u2019s conclusion, Lee\u2019s battered army <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">retreated across the Potomac</span></b> into Virginia; the Union victory allowed President Lincoln to issue the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emancipation Proclamation</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Fredericksburg</span></b> (December 13, 1862). At this site, about 50 miles south of Washington, Union commander <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ambrose Burnside</span></b> (who had replaced George McClellan) tried to take the initiative and cross the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rappahannock River</span></b> in a march toward Richmond. He met Robert E. Lee\u2019s forces, which were well entrenched on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Marye\u2019s Heights</span></b> behind the town. Burnside\u2019s army took heavy losses assaulting the heights, and fell back across the Rappahannock. A later attempt to flank the Confederate position was foiled by heavy rain during the so-called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cMud March\u201d</span></b> of January 1863.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Vicksburg Campaign</span></b> (April 29\u00a0\u2013 July 4, 1863). This campaign was launched by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ulysses S. Grant</span></b> to take control of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mississippi River</span></b> and cut off the western Confederate states from the east. Grant ordered forces led by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">James McPherson</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John McClernand</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">William Tecumseh Sherman</span></b> through bayous west of the Mississippi to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hard Times, Louisiana</span></b>. They were up against Confederate defenders under <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joseph Johnston</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Pemberton</span></b>. Sherman and McPherson drove Johnston from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jackson, Mississippi</span></b> on May 14, and the Union scored a victory at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Champion\u2019s Hill</span></b> two days later, but could not drive the Southerners out of Vicksburg, so Grant laid siege to the town. Outnumbered 71,000 to 20,000 and on the brink of starvation, Pemberton finally surrendered his men; Johnston withdrew east.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Chancellorsville</span></b> (May 1\u20134, 1863). A victory for the South, but with great cost, as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stonewall Jackson</span></b> lost his life. Lincoln called on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cFighting Joe\u201d Hooker</span></b> to command the Union army; Hooker took a force of 134,000 and provoked <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert E. Lee</span></b> and Jackson\u2019s 60,000 men into battle. Jackson moved around Hooker and counterattacked the Union flank on May 2. That night, while Jackson was on reconnaissance, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">his own men</span></b> mistook him for a Northerner and shot him; he died of pneumonia eight days later. The following morning, a cannonball blast hit the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chancellor House</span></b>, knocking Hooker unconscious; Union troops, led by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Sedgwick</span></b>, then retreated. Casualties for the North outnumbered those of the South, 17,000 to 13,000.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Gettysburg</span></b> (July 1\u20133, 1863). This marked both the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">farthest northward</span></b> advance by the Confederacy and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">turning point</span></b> that led to its defeat. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert E. Lee</span></b>, along with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">James Longstreet</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">A.\u00a0P. Hill</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Richard Ewell</span></b>, led the attack into southern Pennsylvania; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">J.\u00a0E.\u00a0B. Stuart</span></b> was supposed to monitor Union movement with his cavalry, but strayed so far east of Gettysburg that his force did not return (exhausted) until the second day of battle. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George Meade</span></b> replaced <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joseph Hooker</span></b> as leader of the Union army; Southern forces drove Northerners through the town of Gettysburg but could not secure key positions at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cemetery Ridge</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Little and Big Round Tops</span></b>. Low on supplies, on the third and final day Lee ordered an attack on the center; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George Pickett</span></b> led his famous <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201ccharge\u201d</span></b> through open fields, where the Union mowed down one-third of his 15,000 men. The Confederates lost 20,000 and Lee retreated to Virginia.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Chattanooga Campaign</span></b> (September\u2013November 1863). It began when Union <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">General William Rosecrans</span></b> forced Confederate commander <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Braxton Bragg</span></b> out of the city on September 9. Ten days later, at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chickamauga</span></b> (in Georgia), Bragg and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">James Longstreet</span></b> turned the tables by whipping Rosecrans, forcing him into a siege position at Chattanooga. Only <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George Thomas</span></b> (the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cRock of Chickamauga\u201d</span></b>) saved Rosecrans\u2019s army from annihilation. Well-developed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">railroad networks</span></b>, however, allowed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ulysses S. Grant</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joseph Hooker</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">William Tecumseh Sherman</span></b> to bring reinforcements. On November 24 Hooker took <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lookout Mountain</span></b> in the southwest, in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBattle Above the Clouds.\u201d</span></b> The next day, Thomas ran right over the Southern force at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Missionary Ridge</span></b>, securing Tennessee for the North.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Wilderness Campaign (or Overland Campaign)</span></b> (May 5\u00a0\u2013 June 12, 1864). The first clash between <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ulysses S. Grant</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert E. Lee</span></b>, this series of conflicts started with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Battle of the Wilderness</span></b>, fought in a dense forest 50 miles northwest of Richmond. At <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Spotsylvania Court House</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George Meade</span></b> assaulted Robert E. Lee\u2019s men, but Lee\u2019s troops were able to hold on near the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBloody Angle.\u201d</span></b>  Advancing within ten miles of Richmond, Grant met Lee at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cold Harbor</span></b> (June 3); he lost 7,000 men to Lee\u2019s 1,500. By the end of the campaign, Grant\u2019s army approached the James River and Lee\u2019s army had suffered severely from a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cwar of attrition.\u201d</span></b></li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Petersburg Campaign</span></b> (June 1864\u00a0\u2013 April 1865). After Cold Harbor, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ulysses S. Grant</span></b> moved south to lay siege to this <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">railroad hub</span></b>, 25 miles from Richmond. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">trenches</span></b> in which much of the fighting took place were similar to those later used in World War\u00a0I. On July 30, Pennsylvania <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">coal miners</span></b> detonated four tons of powder in a tunnel underneath the Confederate line; this <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBattle of the Crater\u201d</span></b> killed many defenders. Although the South held the city of Petersburg, its supplies ran thin in the winter of 1865. Grant finally destroyed the Confederate right flank at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Five Forks</span></b> (April 1\u20132), 14 miles southwest of Petersburg. This resounding defeat led to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert E. Lee</span></b>\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House</span></b> one week later, effectively ending the Civil War.</li>"

Britain incorporated its <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Gold Coast Colony</span></b> in 1821 after seizing the chartered lands of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">African Company of Merchants</span></b>, which had continued to trade in slaves after Britain had outlawed the trade in 1807; Britain subsequently subsumed other nations\u2019s holdings in the region into the British Gold Coast.

At the time, <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section1\">all electoral votes were cast in the presidential race rather than having a separate ballot for the vice presidency</a>. Thus both Jefferson and Democratic-Republican VP candidate <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aaron Burr</span></b> had 73 electoral votes, and Burr refused to step aside. In the House of Representatives, neither man won the necessary nine state delegations outright until the 36th ballot, when <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">James Bayard</span></b> of Delaware cast a blank vote, turning the election in Jefferson\u2019s favor.  The debacle led to the ratification of the <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxii\">12th amendment</a> in 1804.  The Federalists never recovered; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Alexander Hamilton</span></b>\u2019s opposition to Adams led to a permanent split between the two, and Hamilton\u2019s opposition to Burr was one cause of their 1804 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">duel</span></b>, in which Burr (then the vice president) killed Hamilton.  This was the first peaceful transfer of power from one party to another.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">1824</span></b>:  The candidates were <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Quincy Adams</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Henry Clay</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">William Crawford</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Andrew Jackson</span></b>, all Democratic-Republicans.  After <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John C. Calhoun</span></b> decided to seek the vice presidency and Crawford (from Georgia) had a stroke, Jackson took most of the South and won the popular vote.  Jackson had 99 electoral votes, Adams 84, Crawford 41, and Clay 37, but since none had more than 50% of the vote, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">the House decided the election</span></b>.  Adams won in the House with support from Clay, and Jacksonians cried foul when <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Clay was made Secretary of State</span></b> (the so-called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201ccorrupt bargain\u201d</span></b>), giving fuel to Jackson\u2019s victorious 1828 campaign.  Jackson is the only candidate to lose a presidential race despite having the most electoral votes, and he is one of five (with Tilden, Cleveland, Gore, and Hillary Clinton) to lose despite winning the popular vote.

Bell took Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia, Breckinridge swept the other slave states, and Lincoln nearly swept the free states.  Though winning under 40% of the total popular vote, Lincoln dominated the electoral count with 180 to a combined 123 for his opponents (Breckinridge 72, Bell 39, Douglas 12).

Tilden <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">won the popular vote</span></b> and seemed to win the election, but results in Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana were contested, as was one vote in Oregon; if Hayes swept these votes, he would win the electoral count 185\u2013184.  In Congress, an informal bargain was reached (often called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Compromise of 1877</span></b>) in which Hayes won the election in exchange for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Reconstruction being brought to an end</span></b>.</li>",

The most prominent issue, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gold standard</span></b> versus <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">free silver</span></b> coinage, led to Bryan\u2019s famous <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5354/\">\u201cCross of Gold\u201d</a> speech.  Shunned by the Eastern press, Bryan \u2014 a legendary orator \u2014 traveled 18,000 miles through 27 states and was heard by some three million people.  McKinley would not accept Bryan\u2019s challenge to debate, comparing it to putting up a trapeze and competing with a professional athlete.  McKinley instead had a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cfront porch\u201d campaign</span></b>, as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">railroads</span></b> brought voters by the thousands to hear him speak in his hometown, Canton, Ohio.  <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mark Hanna</span></b>, McKinley\u2019s campaign manager, is often considered the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">first modern campaign manager</span></b>.

The first Kennedy-Nixon <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">debate</span></b> (September\u00a026, 1960) is a classic in political science; those who saw the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">calm, handsome</span></b> Kennedy and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tired, uncomfortable</span></b>-looking Nixon on television were more likely to select Kennedy as the winner than were those who listened on radio.

Five men in the crowd were killed, including former slave <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Crispus Attucks</span></b>. The crowd was originally upset that British private <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hugh White</span></b> had struck a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">wigmaker\u2019s apprentice</span></b> in the head earlier that day. Massachusetts governor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thomas Hutchinson</span></b> ordered an inquiry into the event, which led to the arrest of thirteen people. Eight soldiers were defended at their trial by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Adams</span></b>, and six were acquitted of murder charges. A notable <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">engraving</span></b> of the Boston Massacre was made by Boston silversmith <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Paul Revere</span></b>.

The victims were lured to a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">warehouse in Lincoln Park</span></b> with the promise of crates of stolen <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">whiskey</span></b>, which was especially valuable during <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Prohibition</span></b>. The only survivor was a dog named <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Highball</span></b>. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jack McGurn</span></b>, one of the gunmen, avoided charges in the massacre thanks to the so-called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBlond Alibi\u201d</span></b> after taking the chief witness against him across state lines and marrying her.

The Japanese troops were commanded by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Prince Yasuhiko Asaka</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Iwane Matsui</span></b>. One famous anecdote from the massacre concerns a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">contest</span></b> between two Japanese soldiers to kill 100 Chinese civilians with a sword. Since Japan was not yet at war with the various Western nations, Chinese civilians who were able to make their way into the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cNanking Safety Zone\u201d</span></b> around the foreign embassies were safe from harm. Episcopalian missionary <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Magee</span></b> extensively photographed the massacre.

Helicopter pilot <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hugh Thompson Jr.</span></b> attempted to radio for help and later rescued a four-year-old girl, for which he was awarded the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Distinguished Flying Cross</span></b>. Photographs of the massacre were taken by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ronald Haeberle</span></b>. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Seymour Hersh</span></b> won a Pulitzer Prize for uncovering the events of the My Lai Massacre through extensive interviews with Calley.

The students were protesting the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nixon administration</span></b>\u2019s bombing of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cambodia</span></b> during the Vietnam War. Ohio governor Jim Rhodes called in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">National Guard</span></b>, which fired into the crowd and killed four students: <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jeffrey Miller</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Allison Krause</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">William Schroeder</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sandra Lee Scheur</span></b>. A photograph taken by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Filo</span></b> of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mary Ann Vecchio</span></b> kneeling over the body of Jeffrey Miller won the Pulitzer Prize. Ten days later, two students at the historically black <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jackson State University</span></b> in Mississippi were killed under similar circumstances, but those shootings received far less press attention. The protest song \u201cOhio\u201d by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young was written shortly after the massacre.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Tiananmen Square Protests</span></b> (June 4, 1989) were a series of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">student-led pro-democracy protests</span></b> in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square during the spring of 1989. One day after the death of former Politburo member <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hu Yaobang</span></b>, students gathered in the public square to demonstrate for greater <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">political freedom</span></b>. The students camped out in the square for over a month, and similar movements took place throughout China. One famous symbol of the protests was the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Goddess of Democracy statue</span></b> erected in the square. Within the Chinese government, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zhao Ziyang</span></b> was sympathetic to the students\u2019 demands, but the paramount leader <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Deng Xiaoping</span></b> viewed the protests as a challenge to his authority. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Martial law</span></b> was declared on May 20, and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">People\u2019s Liberation Army</span></b> began clearing the square late at night on June 3.

Like many <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Creoles</span></b>, or people of European descent born in the Americas, Iturbide feared that the insurgency would upset <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">colonial hierarchies of race and class</span></b>. In 1820, however, a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">liberal revolution in Spain</span></b> caused conservative Mexican elites to reconsider the benefits of independence.

An 1855 law named after Ju\u00e1rez sought to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">eliminate special privileges</span></b> given to members of the church and military, and was incorporated into a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">new constitution</span></b> ratified in 1857. Conservative backlash soon led to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">War of the Reform</span></b>, which lasted from 1857 to 1861, and left the victorious Liberals with little money in the national treasury. France\u2019s emperor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Napoleon\u00a0III</span></b> then used Mexico\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">foreign debts</span></b> to as a pretext for an invasion known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cFrench Intervention,\u201d</span></b> which briefly imposed the Austrian archduke <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Maximilian</span></b> as Mexico\u2019s second emperor. As the elected president of Mexico, Ju\u00e1rez <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">evaded capture</span></b> by French and imperial troops while rallying Republican forces. After the departure of the French, Liberal troops captured and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">executed</span></b> Maximilian on the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hill of the Bells</span></b> in the city of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Quer\u00e9taro</span></b>. Ju\u00e1rez returned to Mexico City, and remained president until his death.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Porfirio D\u00edaz</span></b> (1830\u20131915) was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Liberal</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">general</span></b> who established a long-lasting <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dictatorship</span></b> that eventually led to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mexican Revolution</span></b>. In 1876 D\u00edaz issued the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Plan of Tuxtepec</span></b> and seized power from the Liberal president <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de\u00a0Tejada</span></b>. D\u00edaz then dominated Mexican politics for the next 35\u00a0years, and served as president continuously between 1884 and 1911 despite his earlier use of the slogan <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cEffective Suffrage and No Re-Election.\u201d</span></b> While in office, D\u00edaz skillfully <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">manipulated</span></b> federal, state, and local politics, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">suppressed dissent</span></b>, tamed the fractious <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mexican army</span></b>, opened Mexico to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">foreign investment</span></b>, and oversaw the beginnings of the country\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">industrial development</span></b>. His supporters praised him as a brilliant statesman who had ended the upheavals of the mid-nineteenth century; his detractors stressed the inequality, corruption, and systematic brutality of the political and economic systems fostered by D\u00edaz and his <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">positivist advisors</span></b>, who were known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cient\u00edficos</span></b>. In 1908 D\u00edaz discussed the possibility of his resignation during an interview with the American journalist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">James Creelman</span></b>, which helped open the door to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">electoral mobilization</span></b>, and eventually to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">armed rebellion</span></b>. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Anti-Reelectionist</span></b> forces of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Francisco Madero</span></b> revolted in 1910 and won their first victories in 1911, sparking uprisings elsewhere in the country. D\u00edaz promptly resigned under terms stipulated in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez</span></b>, and spent the last years of his life in comfortable <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">European exile</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Francisco Madero</span></b> (1873\u20131913) led the 1910 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">revolution against Porfirio D\u00edaz</span></b>, and served as president of Mexico from 1911 to 1913. As the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">idealistic</span></b> son of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">wealthy Coahuilan</span></b> family, Madero was in some ways an unlikely revolutionary. However, Madero\u2019s idealism allowed him to challenge D\u00edaz with a boldness that more powerful politicians and generals had lacked. After the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Creelman interview</span></b> was released, Madero wrote a book titled <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Presidential Succession in 1910</i>, which argued that it was time for D\u00edaz to be replaced, and which revived D\u00edaz\u2019s former slogan, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cEffective Suffrage and No Re-Election.\u201d</span></b> Madero then ran for president, but was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arrested</span></b> before the election. After <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">escaping from prison</span></b>, Madero issued the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed</span></b>, which called for a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">general revolt</span></b> in November 1910. Dissatisfaction with the D\u00edaz regime coalesced around Madero, who unseated the dictator and took power after democratic elections were held in the fall of 1911. However, Madero was unable to satisfy the far-reaching demands of the diverse coalition that had brought him to power. Madero was also disliked by the American ambassador <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Henry Lane Wilson</span></b> and by former supporters of the D\u00edaz regime, many of whom retained their positions in the government and army. In February 1913, Wilson encouraged General <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Victoriano Huerta</span></b> to participate in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">coup</span></b> against Madero. After a period of fighting within Mexico City that is known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Decena Tr\u00e1gica</span></b>, or Tragic Ten Days, Madero was forced to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">resign</span></b>. Huerta became president, and Madero was murdered a few days later.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Venustiano Carranza</span></b> (1859\u20131920) was the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cFirst Chief\u201d of the Constitutionalist army</span></b> during the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mexican Revolution</span></b>, and president of Mexico from 1917 to 1920. After the death of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Francisco Madero</span></b>, Carranza issued the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Plan of Guadalupe</span></b>, and became the nucleus of opposition to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Victoriano Huerta</span></b>\u2019s regime. Carranza\u2019s movement was supported by the generals <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pancho Villa</span></b>, who assembled armies in northern Mexico and pushed south to the capital. The southern general <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emiliano Zapata</span></b> also allied with Carranza to remove Huerta from power. After Huerta was forced to resign in 1914, members of Carranza\u2019s movement held a convention in the city of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aguascalientes</span></b>. The convention formed a new government that was supported by Villa and Zapata, but opposed by Gonz\u00e1lez and Obreg\u00f3n. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Constitutionalist</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Convention</span></b> forces battled until 1915, when Carranza\u2019s adherents gained the upper hand and the Convention split into separate factions, some of which continued to fight the Constitutionalists for years. Carranza went on to call for a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">new constitution</span></b>, to be based on the Liberal Constitution of 1857. The ensuing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Constitution of 1917</span></b> went far beyond the minor reforms that Carranza had envisioned, and promoted <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">land redistribution</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">workers\u2019 rights</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">anticlericalism</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">national ownership of Mexico\u2019s natural resources</span></b>. Over the next several years, Carranza proved reluctant to enact the 1917 constitution\u2019s more radical provisions, or to give up control of the government. Obreg\u00f3n forced Carranza to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">flee</span></b> the capital in 1920, and likely had a role in Carranza\u2019s subsequent <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">assassination</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Emiliano Zapata</span></b> (1879\u20131919) and <b><span class=\"label\">Pancho Villa</span></b> (born Doroteo Arango) (1878\u20131923) were both early supporters of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Francisco Madero</span></b>, opponents of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Victoriano Huerta</span></b>, and leaders of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Convention forces</span></b> during the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mexican Revolution</span></b>. Villa chiefly operated in northern Mexico, while Zapata was based in his home state, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Morelos</span></b>, south of Mexico City. In 1911 Villa and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pascual Orozco</span></b> led Maderista forces at the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Battle of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez</span></b>, while Zapata issued the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Plan of Ayala</span></b>, which called for the breakup of large <i class=\"ygk-term\">haciendas</i> and the restoration of communal lands known as <i class=\"ygk-term\">ejidos</i>. During Madero\u2019s presidency Villa was imprisoned by Victoriano Huerta, who also conducted a brutal military campaign against the peasant supporters of Zapata. After Madero\u2019s death, Villa joined Carranza\u2019s army as the leader of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Divisi\u00f3n del Norte</span></b>, or Division of the North, and Zapata established himself as the central leader of the various <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">southern guerrilla movements</span></b>. At the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Convention of Aguascalientes</span></b>, Villa\u2019s supporters sought to promote the rights of peasants and workers; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zapatistas</span></b> took a less active role at the meeting, but were willing to support the Convention government in opposition to Carranza. In the subsequent fighting, Zapatista soldiers <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">took the capital</span></b> several times but were <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unable to hold it</span></b> after 1915, the same year that Villa suffered defeats at the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">battles of Celaya</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Agua Prieta</span></b>. Zapata retreated to Morelos and carried out local <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">land reforms</span></b> as the Constitutionalists focused on defeating Villa, who sought to obtain supplies by carrying out a 1916 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">raid on the American town of Columbus, New Mexico</span></b>. In response to this incursion, the U.S. sent a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cpunitive expedition\u201d</span></b> led by General <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John J. Pershing</span></b> to (unsuccessfully) pursue Villa across northern Mexico. The influence of Villa and Zapata declined, and both were eventually <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">assassinated</span></b>. However, the two men remain symbols of the Revolution\u2019s popular aspirations. Zapata in particular has served as an inspiration to later movements such as the Chiapas-based EZLN, or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zapatista Army of National Liberation</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas</span></b> (1895\u20131970) was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">revolutionary general</span></b> who served as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">president</span></b> from 1934 to 1940, and who worked to fulfill the Constitution of 1917\u2019s promises of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">land reform</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">nationalization</span></b> of key resources. After Carranza\u2019s death, Mexico was ruled by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cSonoran dynasty\u201d</span></b> of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Plutarco El\u00edas Calles</span></b>, who stabilized the country and implemented limited reforms. Calles also founded a forerunner of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">PRI</span></b>, or Institutional Party of the Revolution, which dominated Mexican politics throughout the 20th century. After stepping down as president, Calles continued to control Mexican politics from 1928 to 1934 during a period known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cMaximato.\u201d</span></b> However, C\u00e1rdenas surprised Calles by turning against him, and forcing him into exile. As president, C\u00e1rdenas also <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">broke up large estates</span></b> into communal <i class=\"ygk-term\">ejidos</i>, promoted <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">organized labor</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">expropriated foreign-owned oil fields</span></b> in 1938 to form the national oil company <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pemex</span></b>, or Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos. These actions made C\u00e1rdenas very popular, but once he left office the Mexican government\u2019s commitment to economic redistribution soon waned. In 1988 L\u00e1zaro\u2019s son <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas</span></b> challenged PRI control of politics by running for president as the candidate of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">PRD</span></b>, or Party of the Democratic Revolution. Although <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">electoral fraud</span></b> prevented Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas from winning, his challenge helped to bring about political changes that eventually led <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Vicente Fox</span></b> of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">PAN</span></b>, or National Action Party, to be elected president in 2000.</li>"

On the French left, British troops defended the walled farm <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hougoumont</span></b> from a series of infantry assaults; in the center, Marshal <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Michel Ney</span></b>\u2019s massed cavalry charge was broken by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">square formations</span></b> of the British infantry; on the right, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Gebhard von\u00a0Bl\u00fccher</span></b>\u2019s Prussian army arrived to attack the French army in the flank.

The guardsmen were cut down by the fire of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">British light infantry</span></b>, leading to the general <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">collapse of the French army</span></b>. Napoleon was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">exiled</span></b> once more, this time to the isolated South Atlantic island <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">St.\u00a0Helena</span></b>, where he died in 1821.</li>\n</ul>",

After failed attempts at reform, Louis called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Estates-General</span></b>, France\u2019s long-dormant parliament, into session in 1789. When the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Third Estate</span></b> (consisting of everyone other than the clergy and nobility) declared itself the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">National Assembly</span></b> and Parisian mobs <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">stormed the Bastille</span></b>, Louis reluctantly became a constitutional monarch. However, he resisted revolutionary policies and eventually tried\u2014and failed\u2014to flee France with his family in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Flight to Varennes</span></b>. In 1792 he was deposed in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Insurrection of August\u00a010</span></b>; he was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">guillotined</span></b> the next year.</li>",

Marie Antoinette\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Austrian background</span></b> made her unpopular with the French people, and her standing worsened when she was wrongfully accused of not paying for jewelry during the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Diamond Necklace Affair</span></b>.

Robespierre was a former lawyer from Arras who joined the Estates-General and, with Danton, led the left-wing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Montagnard</span></b> faction of the Jacobin Club. Robespierre supported a French republic, and his strict ideological and moral principles earned him the nickname <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cthe Incorruptible.\u201d</span></b> In 1793 he rose to dominate the Committee of Public Safety and led its campaign to eliminate enemies of the revolution.

To avoid arrest, Marat hid in Paris\u2019s sewers, which gave him a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">debilitating skin condition</span></b>, which he treated by taking long <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">baths</span></b>. In 1792 he supported the overthrow of the king and generated support for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">September Massacres</span></b>, in which mobs killed thousands of prisoners.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Antonine Plague</span></b> spread across the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Roman Empire</span></b> from AD\u00a0165 to 180. Roman troops brought the disease into the Mediterranean world after returning from war against <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Parthia</span></b> in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mesopotamia</span></b>. The outbreak is named for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Antonine dynasty</span></b>, which ruled Rome at the time under co-emperors <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Marcus Aurelius</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lucius Verus</span></b> (the latter of whom likely died of the plague); the dynasty\u2019s founder, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Antoninus Pius</span></b>, had died in AD\u00a0161. The physician <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Galen</span></b> wrote detailed accounts of the outbreak, which allowed modern scholars to determine that the plague was likely either <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">smallpox</span></b> or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">measles</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Plague of Justinian</span></b> is a common name for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">first plague pandemic</span></b> that swept Europe and Asia beginning during the 540s. The plague struck <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Constantinople</span></b> during the reign of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Justinian\u00a0I</span></b>, who was attempting to reassert Roman control over the Mediterranean. It was caused by the bacterium <i class=\"ygk-term\">Yersinia pestis</i>, the same agent that later caused the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Black Death</span></b>. The plague and its many recurrences devastated <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Byzantium</span></b> and neighboring countries like the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sassanid Empire</span></b>; their weakened states helped enable the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Muslim conquests</span></b> in the 7th century.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Black Death</span></b> is a common name for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">second plague pandemic</span></b> which spread in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mid-14th century</span></b>. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mongol</span></b> forces likely introduced the plague to Europe while besieging the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Genoese colony of Kaffa</span></b> in Crimea. Over the following decade, the disease killed roughly half of the continent\u2019s population. It also sparked major social disruptions, including <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">peasant revolts</span></b> in England and France and mass <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">anti-semitism</span></b>, due to many blaming the plague on Jews. The frame story for Giovanni Boccaccio\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Decameron</i> involves ten people fleeing the plague in Florence. Scattered plague outbreaks continued across Europe for the next 300 years, including the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Great Plague of London</span></b> in 1665. It is likely the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">deadliest</span></b> pandemic ever.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Syphilis</span></b>, a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sexually transmitted disease</span></b>, spread across Europe beginning in the 1490s. While its origins are disputed, many Renaissance and contemporary scholars believe it came to Europe <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">from the Americas</span></b> after Christopher Columbus\u2019s voyages. It was first described among <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">French troops invading Naples</span></b> in 1495 and known then as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cgreat pox.\u201d</span></b> Syphilis remained a major public health threat in the western world until the introduction of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">penicillin</span></b> in the 1940s. In the 20th century, the U.S. government conducted a study in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tuskegee, Alabama</span></b> that involved intentionally and inhumanely not treating hundreds of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Black men</span></b> infected with the disease.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Typhus</span></b>, an infectious fever carried by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">lice</span></b>, spread across Europe in the late 1400s. While it may have been responsible for ancient pandemics, typhus was first conclusively identified among <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Spanish troops</span></b> attacking Granada near the end of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Reconquista</span></b> (15th century). Later typhus epidemics often coincided with military conflicts, for instance, causing most of the deaths during the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thirty Years\u2019 War</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Russia</span></b>. Typhus killed many victims of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Holocaust</span></b>, including <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Anne Frank</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Smallpox</span></b>, a disease caused by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">variola</span></b> virus, circulated as early as 1500\u00a0BC. While the disease became <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">endemic</span></b> across Europe and Asia, it caused devastation when introduced to new populations. Smallpox came to the Americas through <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Spanish conquistadors</span></b>, causing millions of deaths among indigenous civilizations like the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aztecs</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Incas</span></b>. Later colonial efforts caused the disease to reach and decimate <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aboriginal Australians</span></b> and other native peoples. Chinese doctors developed strategies for inoculating against smallpox in the 1500s, while <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Edward Jenner</span></b> created the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">first ever vaccine</span></b> to prevent it in 1796 using the similar <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cowpox</span></b> virus. A successful 20th-century campaign by the World Health organization led to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">eradication</span></b> of smallpox in 1980. </li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Cholera</span></b> is an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">intestinal</span></b> infection that originated in India. Largely as a consequence of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">British colonialism</span></b>, cholera swept the globe during six pandemics in the 19th century. In the U.S. the disease killed former president James Polk and caused many deaths along the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Oregon Trail</span></b>. While studying cholera in London, epidemiologist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Snow</span></b> recognized the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Broad Street pump</span></b> as the common link in an outbreak and concluded that the disease was water-borne. Though now less fatal due to available treatments, cholera persists in large parts of the world; it killed over 10,000 people during a 2010s outbreak in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Haiti</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Spanish Flu pandemic</span></b> killed up to 100 million people from 1918 to 1920. Caused by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">H1N1</span></b> strain of influenza, the disease was first documented in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">U.S. army camp in Kansas</span></b>. It acquired its misleading name because Spain was one of the few countries not to censor information about it amid <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">World War\u00a0I</span></b>, a conflict that drove the disease\u2019s spread. Because Spanish flu often caused <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cytokine storms</span></b> in its victims, it disproportionately affected younger people. Notable victims of the pandemic included <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Gustav Klimt</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Max Weber</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">AIDS</span></b>, a condition caused by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">HIV</span></b> (the human immunodeficiency virus), triggered a pandemic beginning in 1981. Originating in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">monkeys</span></b>, the virus jumped to humans in the early 20th century but did not spread widely until decades later. It is primarily <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sexually transmitted</span></b> and devastated <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gay communities</span></b> across the world in the 1980s and \u201990s, largely due to intentional government inaction. The AIDS epidemic has also devastated <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sub-Saharan Africa</span></b>; a 2013 study estimated that nearly 80% of all people currently living with HIV were from southern Africa. Gay journalist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Randy Shilts</span></b> chronicled the early pandemic and government indifference in his book <i class=\"ygk-term\">And the Band Played On</i>; he later died of AIDS himself. Public awareness of HIV/AIDS increased as it killed celebrities like <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rock Hudson</span></b>. The introduction of the drug <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">AZT</span></b> in 1987, later accompanied by other drugs, slowly helped reduce the disease\u2019s mortality rate from nearly 100%. The pandemic spurred many works of art and literature, including the play <i class=\"ygk-term\">Angels in America</i> and the massive <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">AIDS Memorial Quilt</span></b>.</li>"

Jackson won a plurality of the popular vote and the Electoral College, but not enough to clinch victory. As a result, the House of Representatives selected among the top three candidates and gave the White House to Adams. Jackson attributed the result to a \u201ccorrupt bargain\u201d in which Clay used his influence in the House to boost Adams in exchange for being named <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Secretary of State</span></b>. Most historians believe that Clay backed Adams because they shared similar views, but Jackson used the issue to unseat Adams in 1832 and win reelection against Clay in 1836.

Jackson, whose own wife Rachel had died after being targeted by negative rumors while he ran for president, supported Eaton and forced his cabinet to resign.

When Johnson violated the act by trying to remove Secretary of War <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Edwin Stanton</span></b>, the House impeached him in March 1868.

The Rosenbergs were found out in 1950 after the spy Klaus Fuchs implicated his courier, Harry Gold, setting off a chain of confessions and exposures that ended with David Greenglass, who exposed Julius and Ethel as part of a plea deal. The Rosenbergs were then aggressively prosecuted by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Roy Cohn</span></b> (later a key figure in the McCarthy Era) and executed in the electric chair at Sing Sing Prison. In 1995 the Venona Project confirmed that Julius bore the codename \u201cLiberal\u201d as a Soviet operative.</li>",
                "<ul class=\"ygk\">\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Sir Francis Walsingham</span></b> (1532\u20131590) is best known as the \u201cspymaster\u201d to Elizabeth\u00a0I. After the accession of Mary\u00a0I to the English throne, Walsingham fled with several prominent Protestants to Europe; there, he became radicalized against Catholicism upon witnessing the St. Bartholomew\u2019s Day Massacre. As personal secretary to Elizabeth, Walsingham amassed a web of contacts, including <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thomas Phelippes</span></b>, the cryptographer who uncovered Mary, Queen of Scots\u2019s complicity in the Babington Plot. In 1587 Walsingham recruited <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Antony Standen</span></b> due to Standen\u2019s friendship with Tuscany\u2019s ambassador to Spain, an arrangement that produced so many advance details about the Spanish Armada that Lord Henry Seymour quipped \u201cyou have fought more with your pen than\u2026our English navy fought with their enemies.\u201d Though it has never been proven, author <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Christopher Marlowe</span></b> is commonly believed to have been a spy for Walsingham.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Giacomo Casanova</span></b> (1725\u20131798) was an adventurer and libertine from the Republic of Venice. He is now best remembered for his affairs, to the extent that his name is synonymous with \u201cwomanizer,\u201d but among many other occupations, he also worked as a spy. His spying, which he described in his French-language memoir <b><span class=\"ygk-term\"><i>Histoire de ma vie</i> (Story of My Life)</span></b>, included a stint working for France gathering information on the British ships docked in Dunkirk. He spent much of his life in exile from his native Venice, running from the authorities to avoid being arrested for his debts, but was allowed to return to Venice in 1774 in exchange for performing espionage work for the republic.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Nathan Hale</span></b> (1755\u20131776) only participated in one spying mission, which failed, but his purported final words have become part of American legend. At the age of 21, Hale was a soldier in the Continental Army and agreed to undertake a spying mission to pose as a neutral citizen, disguised as a Dutch schoolmaster, in New York City. Hale was almost immediately exposed (possibly by his Loyalist cousin) and subsequently interrogated by Commander-in-Chief <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">William Howe</span></b> and then hanged as a spy. His supposed final words, much quoted in Patriot propaganda, were <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cI only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.\u201d</span></b></li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Culper Ring</span></b> (active 1778\u20131783) was organized by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Benjamin Tallmadge</span></b> (a schoolmate of Nathan Hale) under the supervision of George Washington. The ring takes its name from Samuel Culper, the alias of chief agent <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Abraham Woodhull</span></b>. The Ring operated near New York City and was very successful: they exposed a plot to render Continental currency worthless through a massive counterfeiting scheme; they found that the 1779 Tryon\u2019s Raid was part of a trap devised by Henry Clinton; and they determined that Benedict Arnold was conspiring with British intelligence officer <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Andr\u00e9</span></b> to hand over West Point. Andr\u00e9 himself was captured on his return from a night meeting with Arnold when he encountered two American soldiers, one of whom was wearing a stolen Hessian officer\u2019s coat, causing Andr\u00e9 to mistake them for allies and identify himself. His captors, ignorant of Arnold\u2019s role, remanded Andr\u00e9 to Arnold\u2019s custody. Tallmadge, however, suspected that Arnold was his accomplice, and Washington had Andr\u00e9 tried and hanged as a spy.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Belle Boyd</span></b> (1844\u20131900) was a society woman from Virginia whose 1866 memoir Belle Boyd in Camp and Prison provides a highly embellished chronicle of her exploits. She claims she listened through a hotel\u2019s closet door to learn of James Shields\u2019s troop maneuvers, which she reported to Stonewall Jackson\u2019s men by literally sprinting across a battlefield. Tracked by operatives of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Allan Pinkerton</span></b>, Boyd was arrested in 1862 and eventually released in a prisoner exchange. Sailing to England with letters from Jefferson Davis, her blockade runner was captured, after which she reportedly seduced her guard to allow the blockade runner\u2019s captain to escape. Though Boyd\u2019s spying contributions were scant, she later became an actress and lecturer on her actions, with the result that she was frequently mythologized in post-war Southern propaganda.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Ferdinand Esterhazy</span></b> (1847\u20131923) was the French military officer and spy for the German Empire who perpetrated the acts of espionage wrongfully pinned on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Alfred Dreyfus</span></b> in 1894, prompting the Dreyfus Affair. Esterhazy is believed to have written a sensitive missive known as the <i class=\"ygk-term\">bordereau</i> that was found in a trash can by a janitor; this was the key evidence in blaming Dreyfus, whose handwriting was determined (by unqualified scholars) to be a match. Gradually, evidence came to light incriminating Esterhazy, including a letter from the German attache in Paris acquired by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Georges Picquart</span></b>. Esterhazy requested a closed-door trial that exonerated him in 1898, which was seen as a cover-up by French commanders to avoid embarrassment at convicting the wrong man.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Sidney Reilly</span></b> (1873\u20131925), known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cAce of Spies,\u201d</span></b> was an extremely prolific Russian-born spy primarily in the service of the U.K. and Japan, though he also worked for Germany and Russia. His identity as Sidney Reilly was likely created by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">William Melville</span></b>, a Scotland Yard agent for whom he worked as an informant. His global career included stints in Port Arthur, where he stole defense plans that allowed Japan to sneak-attack Port Arthur to spark the Russo-Japanese War; in France, where he snuck onto a Rothschild family yacht to try to convince William Knox D\u2019Arcy to sell his oil rights to the British government; in Germany, where he pretended to be a factory foreman named Karl Hahn to steal weapons plans for Britain; and in Russia, where he may have led a failed 1918 plot to overthrow the Bolsheviks. Undercover agents in Russia eventually exposed him, leading to his execution in 1925.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Mata Hari</span></b> (1876\u20131917) was an exotic dancer who used her neutral Dutch citizenship to spy for France, and possibly also for Germany, in World War\u00a0I. Born <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Margaretha Zelle</span></b>, she adopted the persona of a Malay princess to further her career, which brought her into sexual relationships with high-ranking military figures and nobles. In 1917, French intelligence determined she was spying for Germany while producing no worthwhile information of benefit to France, leading to her arrest and conviction, though scholarship is still sharply divided on whether she was merely a high-profile scapegoat. Both pop culture and academia have long been intrigued by the racy appeal of Mata Hari\u2019s story, embodied by her 1917 execution, at which she blew kisses to her firing squad, though photographic records disprove urban legends that she wore a lavish new outfit for her execution.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Cambridge Five</span></b> (active 1934\u20131951) was a quintet of British agents disillusioned about capitalism who were recruited as Soviet spies while attending Cambridge University. Supervised by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Yuri Modin</span></b> of the KGB, it included <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Donald MacLean, Guy Burgess, John Cairncross, Anthony Blunt, and Kim Philby</span></b>. The KGB believed Maclean and Burgess to be exceptionally sloppy in maintaining their covers, but the two agents still passed over 9,000 secret wartime documents to the KGB before fleeing the U.K. in 1951, at which point the British press learned of the existence of the ring. Kim Philby maintained his innocence until 1963, when he defected during an intelligence mission to Beirut.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Julius and Ethel Rosenberg</span></b> (1918\u20131953 and 1915\u20131953) were a married couple from New York City who supplied Manhattan Project secrets to the Soviets. Julius recruited many informants, whose raw intelligence was then typed up by Ethel. The most important Rosenberg recruits were <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Russell McNutt</span></b>, who worked at Oak Ridge Laboratory, and Ethel\u2019s brother <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">David Greenglass</span></b>, who worked at Los Alamos and ferried Julius diagrams of atomic weapons.

                "<li><i class=\"label\">Plessy v. Ferguson</i> (Henry B. Brown, Melville Fuller, 7\u20131, 1896): Homer Plessy (who was legally classified as an \u201coctoroon,\u201d meaning one-eighth black) bought a first-class ticket on the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">East Louisiana Railway</span></b>.  He sat in the whites-only car in violation of an 1890 Louisiana law mandating <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">separate accommodations</span></b>.  He was convicted, but appealed to the Supreme Court against John Ferguson, a Louisiana judge.  The court upheld the law provided that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cseparate but equal\u201d</span></b> facilities were provided.  John Marshall Harlan issued a famous dissent claiming <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cOur constitution is color-blind.\u201d</span></b> <i>Plessy</i> was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">overturned by <i>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas</i></span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Marbury v. Madison</i> (John Marshall, 4\u20130, 1803): On his final day in office in 1801, John Adams signed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">commissions for 42 federal judges</span></b> (the so-called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cmidnight judges\u201d</span></b>).  His successor, Thomas Jefferson, opted to not deliver most of the commissions.  One appointee, William Marbury, sued the new secretary of state, James Madison, to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">force the delivery of his commission</span></b>.  The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Judiciary Act of 1789</span></b> had granted the court original jurisdiction in such cases, but the Constitution did not.  The court ruled that the Judiciary Act <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">conflicted with the Constitution and was therefore void</span></b>.  Therefore Marbury\u2019s request was denied for lack of jurisdiction.  This case established the principle of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">judicial review</span></b>, the power of the court to nullify unconstitutional laws.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Roe v. Wade</i> (Harry Blackmun, Warren Burger, 7\u20132, 1973): Norma McCorvey (under the alias Jane Roe), a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">rape victim</span></b>, sued Dallas County attorney Henry Wade for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">right to an abortion</span></b>.  When the case reached the Supreme Court, the plaintiff depended on the growing recognition of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cright to privacy,\u201d</span></b> which began with the 1965 case <i class=\"ygk-term\">Griswold v. Connecticut</i>.  The court <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">struck down state anti-abortion laws as \u201cunconstitutionally vague,\u201d</span></b> held that the word \u201cperson\u201d in the Constitution \u201cdoes not include the unborn,\u201d and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">legalized abortion in the first trimester</span></b>.  McCorvey later joined the pro-life movement and claimed that she was not actually raped and that she was pressured into filing the case by her ambitious attorney Sarah Weddington.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas</i> (Earl Warren, 9\u20130, 1954): The suit was filed on behalf of Linda Brown, a third grader, who had to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">walk a mile to a blacks-only school when a whites-only school was much closer</span></b>.  Future Supreme Court Justice <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thurgood Marshall</span></b> argued the case for the plaintiff.  The court <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">overturned <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i></span></b> and ruled that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cseparate but equal\u201d facilities were not constitutional</span></b>.  A second case in 1955 required that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">desegregation proceed \u201cwith all deliberate speed\u201d</span></b> but Southern schools were notoriously slow in complying; it was not until 1970 that a majority had complied with the ruling.</li>",

Maryland</i> (John Marshall, 9\u20130, 1819): After the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Second Bank of the United States</span></b> began calling in loans owed by the states, Maryland passed a law <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">taxing out-of-state banks</span></b>.  The federal bank refused to pay, so the state sued its Baltimore cashier, James McCulloch.  The court ruled that the federal government had the right to establish the bank even though it was not expressly enumerated in the Constitution and also noted that since <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cthe power to tax was the power to destroy,\u201d</span></b> Maryland could not tax the bank without destroying federal sovereignty.</li>",

Baker, a Tennessee citizen, sued the Tennessee secretary of state, Joe Carr, claiming that the state\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">electoral districts had been drawn to grossly favor one political party</span></b>.  The defendant argued that reapportionment issues were political, not judicial, matters, but the court disagreed and declared the issue justiciable before remanding the case to a lower court.

Because his crime was not capital, the court declined to provide him with an attorney.  He was convicted, sued Louie Wainwright \u2014 the director of the corrections office \u2014 and took his case to the Supreme Court.  The court overruled <i class=\"ygk-term\">Betts v. Brady</i> and held that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments required <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">appointed counsel in all trials</span></b>.  Gideon was retried and found innocent.

Hammer in Charlotte since his two sons would be put out of work.  The court ruled that the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">federal government did not have the right to regulate child labor</span></b>; Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a notable dissent focusing on the lack of proper state regulation.  The case was overturned by the 1941 case <i class=\"ygk-term\">U.S. v. Darby Lumber Company</i> case upholding the Fair Labor Standards Act.</li>",

The legislators were mostly defeated in the next elections and the incoming politicians voided the sales.  In the meantime, John Peck sold some of the land in question to Robert Fletcher, who then sued him, claiming that he did not have clear title.  The Supreme Court held that the state legislature did not have the power to repeal the sale.

Lieutenant John Merryman of the Maryland cavalry took an active role in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">evicting Union soldiers from Maryland</span></b> following the attack on Fort Sumter.

Georgia claimed that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sovereign immunity</span></b> protected it from Chisholm\u2019s suit. However, the Supreme Court held that Article\u00a0III, Section\u00a02 of the Constitution gave citizens the right to sue a state, finding against Georgia. The Court\u2019s ruling proved so controversial that it resulted in the 1794 passage of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eleventh Amendment</span></b>, which specifically prohibited U.S. or foreign citizens from filing a lawsuit against a state (with certain exceptions).</li>",

Ogden</i> (John Marshall, 6\u20130, 1824) Thomas Gibbons and Aaron Ogden were partners in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">steamboat</span></b> business that ferried people between New York and New Jersey. Ogden had purchased a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">license granting him a monopoly</span></b> under New York law. After the partners suffered a disagreement and split up, Gibbons applied for and received a federal permit to run a similar business. Ogden sued Gibbons for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">violating Ogden\u2019s monopoly</span></b>. In a unanimous decision, Marshall held that Congress\u2019 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">interstate regulatory power</span></b> under the Commerce Clause had \u201cno limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution.\u201d Gibbons\u2019 federal permit trumped Ogden\u2019s state-granted monopoly.</li>",

In 1853, Scott sued his then-owner John Sanford for his freedom. The Supreme Court ruled that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">no African-American \u2014 slave or free \u2014 was a citizen</span></b> of the United States, and that therefore Scott <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">lacked standing to initiate a lawsuit</span></b> in the first place. In addition, the Court <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">found the Missouri Compromise to be unconstitutional</span></b>, holding that Congress lacked authority to prohibit slavery in any new territory that was not originally part of the United States.</li>",

In 1871, the Illinois legislature passed a law setting <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">maximum rates for grain storage</span></b>. On appeal to the Supreme Court, lawyers for the business claimed that the Illinois statute violated Fourteenth-Amendment <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">due process rights regarding private property</span></b>. Chief Justice Waite\u2019s opinion upheld the Illinois law, and proclaimed that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cwhen private property is devoted to a public use, it is subject to public regulation.\u201d</span></b> The decision was a landmark in the history of government regulation of businesses, especially railroads.</li>",

Oregon\u2019s statute was upheld on the grounds that the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">state had a compelling interest in protecting the health of its female workers</span></b>.

Charles Schenck was a Socialist who opposed conscription and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">distributed literature urging readers to resist the draft</span></b>. Follwing his arrest and conviction, he appealed, claiming that his advocacy was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">protected speech</span></b> covered by the First Amendment. Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Holmes claimed the First Amendment does not protect speech that creates a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cclear and present danger,\u201d</span></b> and that \u201cthe most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">falsely shouting \u2018fire\u2019 in a theatre</span></b>.\u201d</li>",

During his initial interrogation by police, Miranda was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">never informed of his Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights</span></b>. Writing for a thin majority, Chief Justice Warren stated that \u201c[p]rior to any questioning, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">[a] person must be warned</span></b> that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed,\u201d laying the groundwork for the iconic <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cMiranda warnings.\u201d</span></b></li>",

In 1958, Virginia residents Richard Loving (a white man) and Mildred Jeter (a woman of both African-American and Native American heritage) were married in Washington, D.C., which did not have such a statute. After returning to their Virginia home, they were arrested and convicted under the Racial Integrity Act.

Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that African-Americans were not citizens and thus did not have the right to bring a lawsuit in federal court.

Sam Bailey was an African-American civil rights activist who worked with Medgar Evers, and Joe Patterson was the Attorney General of Mississippi.

In 1800 Burr swung New York to his running mate Jefferson, but due to a constitutional quirk, he wound up tying him in the Electoral College. Burr made a covert effort to become president with support from the Federalist Party, but it was blocked by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Alexander Hamilton</span></b>, whom Burr later killed in a duel.

German forces also <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">besieged the Belgian town Bastogne</span></b> and requested its surrender, to which U.S. Army <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe replied \u201cNuts!\u201d</span></b>; the siege was eventually lifted by forces commanded by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George Patton</span></b>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other notable battles in Europe included the <span class=\"ygk-term\">Battle of France</span>, the <span class=\"ygk-term\">Siege of Leningrad</span>, the <span class=\"ygk-term\">Battle of Moscow</span>, the <span class=\"ygk-term\">Battle of Anzio</span>, the <span class=\"ygk-term\">Battle of Monte Cassino</span>, <span class=\"ygk-term\">Operation Market Garden</span>, and the <span class=\"ygk-term\">Battle of Berlin</span>.</p>\n</section>",

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">London, 1851: Great Exhibition\u201d</span></b> The Great Exhibition was the first ever \u201cWorld\u2019s Fair.\u201d The event was largely organized by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Prince Albert</span></b> and was held in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cCrystal Palace,\u201d</span></b> a structure nearly three times larger than St.\u00a0Paul\u2019s Cathedral. Exhibitors included <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Samuel Colt</span></b>, who brought a prototype of his \u201cNavy\u201d pistol, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mathew Brady</span></b>, a pioneer of daguerreotypes. A boating race held in conjunction with the exhibition was won by a ship called <i>America</i>, leading to its prize becoming known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">America\u2019s Cup</span></b>. It also featured the world\u2019s first modern <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pay toilets</span></b>, which cost a penny to use. The Crystal Palace remained in use for decades after the event was over, but was destroyed by a fire in 1936.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Paris, 1889: Exposition Universelle</span></b> Although Paris had hosted the World\u2019s Fair three times before, its 1889 event was easily its most iconic. It is best known for its centerpiece, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eiffel Tower</span></b>, which was by far the tallest structure in the world when it was completed. Exhibits were placed throughout the Champ de Mars, including the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cStreets of Cairo,\u201d</span></b> an elaborate interpretation of Egypt\u2019s capital. Another of its most popular attractions was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201chuman zoo,\u201d</span></b> in which various indigenous and other non-white people were put on display, a practice that was largely accepted at the time. The Eiffel Tower was scheduled to be dismantled 20 years after the 1889 fair, but its usefulness in telegraphy led to those plans being scrapped.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Chicago, 1893: World\u2019s Columbian Exposition</span></b> Chicago\u2019s 1893 fair was nicknamed the \u201cColumbian Exposition\u201d to honor the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus\u2019s voyages to the \u201cNew World.\u201d A massive pool representing Columbus\u2019s voyage served as its centerpiece. Other debuts at the fair included the first <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ferris Wheel</span></b>, the first chocolate <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">brownies</span></b>, and the first <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201csquished penny\u201d souvenirs</span></b>. The event is also associated with multiple controversies. Chicago mayor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Carter Harrison</span></b> was assassinated during its final days, leading to the cancellation of the closing ceremony. Additionally, serial killer <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">H.\u00a0H. Holmes</span></b> and his so-called \u201cMurder Castle\u201d are often tied to the fair, though their actual connection is likely minimal. Both the fair and the associated crimes are detailed in Erik Larson\u2019s book <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Devil in the White City</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">St.\u00a0Louis, 1904: Louisiana Purchase Exposition</span></b> The 1904 World\u2019s Fair was held to honor the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase. It saw the debut of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">X-ray machine</span></b> and inspired the popular song <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cMeet Me in St.\u00a0Louis, Louis.\u201d</span></b> The fair featured daily re-enactments of battles from the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Second Boer War</span></b>, many of which featured people who had actually fought in it. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">1904 Summer Olympics</span></b> had been awarded to Chicago but were re-located to St.\u00a0Louis so they could be held alongside the fair. That change led to very sparse attendance and poorly run events over the course of several months. Novelist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kate Chopin</span></b> suffered a brain hemorrhage while visiting the 1904 fair and died two days later.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Brussels, 1958</span></b> The first full-scale world\u2019s fair after World War\u00a0II was held in Brussels in 1958. A lasting symbol of the Brussels fair is the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Atomium</span></b>, a 335-foot model of a unit cell of an iron crystal. The structure, which remains among the city\u2019s most popular attractions, is approximately 165 billion times larger than the cell it represents. The fair also featured the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Po\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique</i>, a piece of electronic music by Edgard Var\u00e8se played in a specialized pavilion designed by Le\u00a0Corbusier. The first universal poll to rank the greatest films was held at the Brussels fair, which was topped by Sergei Eisenstein\u2019s <i>Battleship Potemkin</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Seattle, 1962: Century 21</span></b> Because of the ongoing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">space race</span></b>, Seattle\u2019s fair had a strong focus on technology and aerospace. Structures built for the fair include the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Space Needle</span></b> and a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">monorail</span></b>, both of which are still standing today. Its \u201cWorld of Science\u201d building housed the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Project Mercury capsule</span></b> that took Alan Shepard to space, and its \u201cWorld of Century 21\u201d building offered glimpses of \u201cthe future\u201d of cities, cars, and air travel. John F. Kennedy intended to attend the closing of the fair, but was unable to because of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The fairgrounds, now known as the Seattle Center, has since become home to the Museum of Pop Culture.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">New York, 1964</span></b> Like the Seattle fair two years earlier, the New York fair was themed around the burgeoning <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Space Age</span></b>, particularly with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Unisphere</span></b>, a massive stainless-steel globe that served as a key symbol of the event. Pope John\u00a0XXIII allowed Michelangelo\u2019s <i>Piet\u00e0</i> to be relocated to the fair\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Vatican Pavilion</span></b>. Elsewhere, Walt Disney designed several animatronic attractions for the fair, including his first incarnation of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cIt\u2019s a Small World\u201d</span></b> ride. While it is generally named for 1964, the fair had a second \u201cseason\u201d the following year as well. A pair of observation towers left over from the fair provide a key plot point to the movie <i>Men in Black</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Montreal, 1967: Expo 67</span></b> Montreal hosted one of the biggest world fairs in history and attracted over half a million visitors just days after opening. One highlight of the fair was the unveiling of Moshe Safdie\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cHabitat 67,\u201d</span></b> a complex of hundreds of interlocking concrete buildings intended as a model community. The U.S. Pavilion at the fair was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">geodesic dome</span></b> designed by Buckminster Fuller, which was later converted into a museum called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Biosphere</span></b>. In a notorious moment, French president Charles de\u00a0Gaulle addressed a crowd in Montreal and declared <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cLong live a free Quebec!,\u201d</span></b> angering many Canadian politicians.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Knoxville, 1982</span></b> In contrast to larger \u201cWorld Expos,\u201d Knoxville held a \u201cspecialized\u201d fair focused on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">energy</span></b>. Structures built for the event include the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sunsphere</span></b>, a 266-foot tower topped with a golden sphere. The fair also featured the debut of an early version of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">touch screen</span></b> and the introduction of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cherry Coke</span></b>. American sports were also featured during the event, with the NFL and NBA both hosting exhibition games at local venues. A fictional version of the Sunsphere had a prominent role in an episode of <i>The Simpsons</i>, in which it was converted into the \u201cWigsphere,\u201d a shop for discount wigs.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Dubai, 2020</span></b> The most recent world fair was scheduled for Dubai in 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it ultimately began in September 2021. The U.S. built a 36,000-square-foot pavilion for the fair, which featured artifacts like <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thomas Jefferson\u2019s copy of the Qur\u2019an</span></b> and a moon rock from the Apollo\u00a017 mission. The fair also played host to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">2021 World Chess Championship</span></b>, which was won by defending champion Magnus Carlsen. Shortly before the fair began, the European Parliament formally <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">opposed</span></b> the event, citing the UAE\u2019s human rights record, though it had little effect on attendance.</li>"

Many of her works reflect her experiences in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bronzeville</span></b>, a neighborhood on Chicago\u2019s South Side that became a center of African-American life during the Great Migration. Her best-known poem, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cWe Real Cool,\u201d</span></b> is set at the Golden Shovel and consists of three-word sentences starting with \u201cWe,\u201d such as \u201cWe\u00a0/ Lurk late\u201d and \u201cWe\u00a0/ Jazz June.\u201d Though primarily a poet, Brooks also wrote the novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Maud Martha</i>.</li>",

At the climax of the novel, the narrator is nearly lynched by a Black nationalist named <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ras the Destroyer</span></b> during riots in Harlem. Ellison\u2019s unfinished second novel was published posthumously in a long version called <i class=\"ygk-term\">Three Days Before the Shooting\u2026</i> and a short version called <i class=\"ygk-term\">Juneteenth</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Lorraine Hansberry</span></b> (1930\u20131965) is best known for her play <i class=\"ygk-term\">A Raisin in the Sun</i>.

Walter wants to invest the money in a liquor store, while his mother <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mama</span></b> wants to buy a house in the white neighborhood <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Clybourne Park</span></b>.

His poems <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cI, Too\u201d</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cLet America Be America Again\u201d</span></b> address America\u2019s racist history and the feelings of exclusion it causes. His poem <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cThe Negro Speaks of Rivers\u201d</span></b> invokes world rivers like the Euphrates and the Congo and repeats the line \u201cMy soul has grown deep like the rivers,\u201d while his poem <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cThe Weary Blues\u201d</span></b> describes a blues performance on Lenox Avenue in Harlem.

                "<li><i class=\"label\">Our Town</i> (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thornton Wilder</span></b>, 1938).  A sentimental story that takes place in the village of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Grover\u2019s Corners, New Hampshire</span></b> just after the turn of the 20th century, <i>Our Town</i> is divided into three acts:  \u201cDaily Life\u201d (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Professor Willard</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Editor Webb</span></b> gossip on the everyday lives of town residents); \u201cLove and Marriage\u201d (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emily Webb</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George Gibbs</span></b> fall in love and marry); and \u201cDeath\u201d (Emily dies while giving birth, and her spirit converses about the meaning of life with other dead people in the cemetery).

O\u2019Neill wrote it fifteen years earlier and presented the manuscript to his third wife with instructions that it not be produced until 25\u00a0years after his death.  Actually produced three years after he died, it centers on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Edmund</span></b> and the rest of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tyrone family</span></b>, but is really an autobiographical account of the dysfunction of O\u2019Neill\u2019s own family, set on one day in August 1912.  The father is a miserly actor, while the mother is a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">morphine</span></b> addict, and the brother is a drunk; they argue and cut each other down throughout the play.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i> (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Edward Albee</span></b>, 1962).  The author Virginia Woolf has little to do with the story, except that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Martha</span></b> sings the title to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George</span></b> when she is mad at him in Act\u00a0I.  In fact, Albee got the title from graffiti he saw on a men\u2019s room wall.  In the drama, George is a professor who married Martha, the college president\u2019s daughter, but the two dislike each other.  Martha invites another couple, the instructor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nick</span></b> and his wife <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Honey</span></b>, for drinks after a party for her father.  All four of them get drunk, and they end up bickering over their flawed marriages:  Besides George and Martha\u2019s problems, Honey is barren, and Nick married her for her money.</li>",

Blanche is a Southern belle who lost the family estate, and is forced to move into her sister <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stella</span></b>\u2019s New Orleans apartment.  Stella\u2019s husband <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stanley</span></b> is rough around the edges, but sees through Blanche\u2019s artifice; he ruins Blanche\u2019s chance to marry his friend <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mitch</span></b> by revealing to Mitch that Blanche was a prostitute.

                "<li><i class=\"label\">A Raisin in the Sun</i> (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lorraine Hansberry</span></b>, 1959).

The first play by an African-American woman to be performed on Broadway, it also tore down the racial stereotyping found in other works of the time.  The title comes from the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Langston Hughes</span></b> poem \"<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46548/harlem\">Harlem</a>\" (often called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cA Dream Deferred\u201d</span></b>).</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">The Crucible</i> (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Arthur Miller</span></b>, 1953).  Miller chose the 1692 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Salem witch trials</span></b> as his setting, but the work is really an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">allegorical</span></b> protest against the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">McCarthy anti-Communist \u201cwitch-hunts\u201d</span></b> of the early 1950s.  In the story, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Elizabeth Proctor</span></b> fires the servant <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Abigail Williams</span></b> after she finds out Abigail had an affair with her husband.  In response, Abigail accuses Elizabeth of witchcraft.  She stands trial and is acquitted, but then another girl accuses her husband, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John</span></b>, and as he refuses to turn in others, he is killed, along with the old comic figure, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Giles Corey</span></b>.

Despite his own failures, he desperately wants his sons <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Biff</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Happy</span></b> to succeed.  Told in a series of flashbacks, the story points to Biff\u2019s moment of hopelessness, when the former high school star catches his father Willy cheating on his mother, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Linda</span></b>.

The Oracle attributes the plague to the fact that the murderer of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Laius</span></b>, the previous king of Thebes, has never been caught and punished. Oedipus then seeks information from the prophet <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Teiresias</span></b>, who is provoked into revealing that Oedipus himself was the killer.

The tragedy takes place in the immediate aftermath of a battle in which Oedipus\u2019s two sons, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Polyneices</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eteocles</span></b>, killed each other while struggling to control <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thebes</span></b>. The current ruler of the city, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Creon</span></b>, has declared that Eteocles will be given an honorable funeral, but Polyneices will be treated as a rebel and left unburied. Oedipus\u2019s daughter <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Antigone</span></b> disobeys Creon\u2019s order, and buries her brother Polyneices against the advice of her frightened sister, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ismene</span></b>. Despite the intervention of Creon\u2019s son <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Haemon</span></b>, who is betrothed to Antigone, Creon sentences Antigone to be entombed alive. Soon after she is imprisoned, Antigone hangs herself. Haemon then commits suicide out of grief, and Creon\u2019s wife <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eurydice</span></b> kills herself when she learns that Haemon is dead.

Most of the play consists of a conversation between Eteocles, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">chorus</span></b>, and a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">spy</span></b> who describes the seven <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">captains</span></b> who have arrived to besiege the seven gates of Thebes.  After each man is described, Eteocles selects the warrior who will face that attacker. When the seventh attacker is revealed to be Polyneices, Eteocles sets off to confront his brother. At the conclusion of the play, it is announced that although Eteocles\u2019s forces have turned back the invaders, the brothers have slain each other. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Antigone</span></b>, the sister of Eteocles and Polyneices, vows to defy the laws of Thebes by giving Polyneices a proper burial.</li>",

Set after the Argonauts\u2019 quest, the play depicts Medea\u2019s vengeance against Jason as he prepares to marry the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Corinthian</span></b> princess <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Glauce</span></b>.  Medea uses <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">poisoned robes</span></b> to kill Glauce and Glauce\u2019s father <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Creon</span></b> (a different character than the Creon who appears in Sophocles\u2019s Theban plays).  Not content with this, Medea seeks to hurt Jason further by killing the sons that she bore him. When Jason tries to confront Medea, she appears above the stage in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">chariot</span></b> pulled by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dragons</span></b>, and exchanges bitter words with her former lover before departing to seek refuge with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">King Aegeus</span></b> of Athens. The play\u2019s ending is a classic example of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">deus ex\u00a0machina</span></b>, a literary device in which plot problems are suddenly resolved by an unexpected contrivance.</li>",

The god first drives the women of the city mad, causing them to act as wild <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Maenads</span></b>.  He then convinces Pentheus to disguise himself in animal skins, and spy on the maddened women.  However, the demented Agave mistakes Pentheus for a mountain lion, and dismembers her own son.  The climax of the play occurs when Agave presents the head of Pentheus to her horrified father, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cadmus</span></b>. As Agave realizes what she has done, Dionysus chastises her for her lack of respect, and foretells how Cadmus will spend his final days.</li>",

However, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Furies</span></b> relentlessly pursue Orestes for his matricide, leading to the events of <i>The Eumenides</i>.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Mary Shelley</span></b> (1797\u20131851, United Kingdom). As the daughter of the philosophers <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">William Godwin</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mary Wollstonecraft</span></b> (the author of <i class=\"ygk-term\">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>), and the wife of the poet <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Percy Bysshe Shelley</span></b>, Mary Shelley was a product of both the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Enlightenment</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Romantic eras</span></b>. Her 1818 novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus</i> helped to lay the groundwork for modern science fiction by contrasting Enlightenment ideas of progress with a Romantic conception of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">nature as an untameable force</span></b>. The idea for <i>Frankenstein</i> came to Shelley while she was taking part in a friendly writing competition at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lord Byron</span></b>\u2019s villa on Lake Geneva. Inspired by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Luigi Galvani</span></b>\u2019s experiments in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201canimal electricity,\u201d</span></b> Shelley wrote about the Swiss scientist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Victor Frankenstein</span></b>, who reanimates dead tissue and creates a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cmonster.\u201d</span></b> This attempt to control nature fails, as the monster <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">murders Frankenstein\u2019s brother William</span></b>, friend <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Henry Clerval</span></b>, and wife <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Elizabeth</span></b> before fleeing to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Arctic</span></b>. Frankenstein pursues his creation, and tells his story to the explorer <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert Walton</span></b> before dying. Shelley presented an even bleaker scenario in her 1826 novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Last Man</i>, which describes <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lionel Verney</span></b>\u2019s efforts to survive a 21st-century plague that devastates human civilization.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Jules Verne</span></b> (1828\u20131905, France). Verne offered a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">brighter vision of technological progress</span></b> in his novels of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">adventure</span></b>, many of which doubled as works of popular science. In Verne\u2019s 1864 novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Journey to the Center of the Earth</i>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Professor Lidenbrock</span></b> explains contemporary theories of geology and paleontology as he leads an expedition that travels beneath the Earth\u2019s crust from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Iceland</span></b> to the Italian volcano <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stromboli</span></b>. Verne later wrote the 1870 novel  <i class=\"ygk-term\">Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</i>, whose narrator <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pierre Aronnax</span></b> offers extensive commentary on marine biology while accompanying the mysterious <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Captain Nemo</span></b> on a voyage in the submarine <i class=\"ygk-term\">Nautilus</i>. In a more realistic vein, Verne considered the possibilities presented by new forms of transportation in the 1873 novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Around the World in Eighty Days</i>, which describes a trip taken by the Englishman <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Phileas Fogg</span></b> and his French valet <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jean Passepartout</span></b>. During his travels, which are undertaken to win a bet with members of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Reform Club</span></b>, Fogg falls in love with an Indian woman named <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aouda</span></b>, and is pursued by the Scotland Yard detective <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Fix</span></b>, who mistakenly believes that Fogg is a bank robber. Fogg ultimately <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">wins his bet</span></b> to return to the Reform Club within 80 days of his departure, with the help of an extra day gained by traveling eastward.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Herbert George Wells</span></b> (1866\u20131946, United Kingdom). H. G. Wells used speculative fiction to explore the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">social issues</span></b> of his day from a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">left-wing</span></b> perspective. In the 1895 novella <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Time Machine</i>, Wells wrote about a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cTime Traveller\u201d</span></b> who visits the year <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">AD\u00a0802,701</span></b>, and learns that humanity has diverged into two different species\u2014the surface-dwelling <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eloi</span></b>, who are gentle and beautiful but intellectually limited, and the subterranean <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Morlocks</span></b>, who resemble apes but are strong and clever enough to use the Eloi as livestock. The Time Traveller speculates that the Eloi are descended from aristocrats who were once served by the ancestors of the Morlocks. After writing about time travel, Wells helped to establish another of science fiction\u2019s key themes by depicting an alien invasion in the 1897 novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">The War of the Worlds</i>. The anonymous narrator of <i>The War of the Worlds</i> observes a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Martian spaceship</span></b> that lands in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Surrey</span></b>, and flees the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cTripods\u201d</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBlack Smoke\u201d</span></b> that the Martians use as weapons in the conquest of Earth. The invaders easily overcome human resistance, but eventually perish from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">lack of immunity</span></b> to Earth microbes. Wells also wrote several novels about researchers who use science to pursue unethical goals. In the 1896 Wells novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Island of Dr.\u00a0Moreau</i>, the shipwrecked <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Edward Prendick</span></b> discovers that the title vivisectionist performs painful experiments to transform animals into human-like <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBeast Folk.\u201d</span></b> A year later Wells published <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Invisible Man</i>, which centers on a student of physics named <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Griffin</span></b> who plans to use his invisibility to enact a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201creign of terror.\u201d</span></b> However, Griffin\u2019s invisibility makes it difficult for him to exist in society (he must cover himself with clothes and thick bandages if he wishes to be seen), and he is eventually killed by an angry crowd.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Aldous Huxley</span></b> (1894\u20131963, United Kingdom). Aldous Huxley belonged to a prominent family of British intellectuals that included the Victorian <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">evolutionist</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thomas Henry Huxley</span></b>. Although Aldous Huxley depicted his own social milieu in novels such as <i class=\"ygk-term\">Crome Yellow</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">Point Counter Point</i>, he is best known for writing about a dystopian <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cWorld State\u201d</span></b> in the 1932 novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Brave New World</i>.  Extrapolating from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Henry Ford</span></b>\u2019s model of industrial production and contemporary advances in biochemistry, Huxley imagined a world in which the fictional <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBokanovsky\u2019s Process\u201d</span></b> is used to create human clones, which are then modified to posses different intellectual abilities, and sorted into social <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">castes</span></b> named after the Greek letters <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Alpha</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Beta</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Gamma</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Delta</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Epsilon</span></b>. Inhabitants of the World State enjoy a prosperous existence, immersive entertainment known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Feelies</span></b>, and the drug <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">soma</span></b>, but lack family connections and spiritual fulfillment. The shallow pleasures of the World State are contrasted with the ideals of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John the Savage</span></b>, a young man who grew up on a New Mexico reservation. John is initially delighted to meet the World State residents <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bernard Marx</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lenina Crowne</span></b>, and excitedly quotes the \u201cBrave New World\u201d speech from Shakespeare\u2019s play <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Tempest</i>.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">George Orwell</span></b> (1903\u20131950, United Kingdom). George Orwell (the pen name of <b><span class=\"label\">Eric Arthur Blair</span></b>) condemned the totalitarian government of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joseph Stalin</span></b> in the fantasy <i class=\"ygk-term\">Animal Farm</i> and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dystopian novel</span></b> <i class=\"ygk-term\">Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>. Orwell\u2019s speculative fiction was part of a wide-ranging body of work that also included <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">attacks on British colonialism</span></b> (the essay \u201cShooting an Elephant\u201d and the novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Burmese Days</i>), first-hand <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">accounts of war</span></b> (<i class=\"ygk-term\">Homage to Catalonia</i>) and poverty (<i class=\"ygk-term\">Down and Out in Paris and London</i>, <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Road to Wigan Pier</i>), and works of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cultural criticism</span></b> (the essay \u201cPolitics and the English Language\u201d). After taking part in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Spanish Civil War</span></b> and growing alarmed at the authoritarian nature of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Russian communism</span></b>, Orwell wrote the 1945 novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Animal Farm</i> as an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">allegory</span></b> of the Russian Revolution and its aftermath. <i>Animal Farm</i> describes barnyard animals who revolt against their owner, and try to create a more equitable society under the leadership of the pig <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Snowball</span></b>, who develops principles of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cAnimalism\u201d</span></b> such as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cFour legs good, two legs bad.\u201d</span></b> However, Snowball is soon ousted by his fellow pig <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Napoleon</span></b>, who exploits the other animals, sends the horse <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Boxer</span></b> to be slaughtered, and degrades the principles of Animalism to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201call animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\u201d</span></b> Four years later, Orwell imagined a future Britain subsumed into <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Oceania</span></b>, a superpower under the harsh rule of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBig Brother\u201d</span></b>, in the novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Winston Smith</span></b> and his lover <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Julia</span></b> try to rebel against Big Brother, but are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tortured</span></b> into compliance in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ministry of Love</span></b>.  <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> also described the distortion of the English language for political purposes (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cNewspeak\u201d</span></b>), and introduced many words and phrases that are still used with reference to oppressive governments (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">thoughtcrime</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">doublethink</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">memory hole</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cwe\u2019ve always been at war with Eastasia,\u201d</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cwar is peace,\u201d</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBig Brother is watching you\u201d</span></b>).</li>",
                "<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Isaac Asimov</span></b> (1920\u20131992, United States). Along with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert A. Heinlein</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Arthur C. Clarke</span></b>, Asimov was one of genre science fiction\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBig Three\u201d</span></b> writers. During the 1930s\u2019 and 1940s\u2019 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cGolden Age\u201d of science fiction pulp magazines</span></b>, Asimov worked closely with <i class=\"ygk-term\">Astounding Science Fiction</i> editor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John W. Campbell Jr.</span></b> to create stories such as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cNightfall,\u201d</span></b> which describes a rare moment of darkness on a planet with multiple suns, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cRobbie,\u201d</span></b> the first of Asimov\u2019s many works about <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">robots</span></b> with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">positronic brains</span></b>. (The word \u201crobot\u201d was introduced by the Czech author <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Karel \u010capek</span></b> in the 1920 play <i class=\"ygk-term\">R.U.R.</i>, which depicts the worldwide uprising of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cRossum\u2019s Universal Robots\u201d</span></b>). Before Asimov, most stories about artificial life had followed the template established by Shelley\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Frankenstein</i>, in which a scientist who tries to usurp God\u2019s power to create life is ultimately destroyed by his own creation.  Asimov challenged this trope by creating the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cThree Laws of Robotics,\u201d</span></b> which robots in his stories are obligated to follow:\n\t\t<ol>\n<li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li>\n<li>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li>\n<li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.</li>\n</ol>\n\t\tBy using these laws in dozens of stories (some of which were collected in the book <i class=\"ygk-term\">I, Robot</i>), Asimov helped to promote a conception of robots as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">useful machines</span></b> rather than inhuman monsters. Asimov is also known for his <i class=\"ygk-term\">Foundation</i> series, which was inspired by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Edward Gibbon</span></b>\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>. The <i class=\"ygk-term\">Foundation</i> series begins when the \u201cpsychohistorian\u201d <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hari Seldon</span></b> realizes that the Galactic Empire will soon fall, and creates the title organization to limit the length of the ensuing Dark Age. Asimov eventually linked together his <i class=\"ygk-term\">Robot</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">Foundation</i> series into a far-reaching \u201chistory of the future,\u201d which also includes Asimov\u2019s novels <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Caves of Steel</i>, <i class=\"ygk-term\">Pebble in the Sky</i>, and <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Stars, Like Dust</i>.\n\t</li>",

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Ray Bradbury</span></b> (1920\u20132012, United States). Bradbury\u2019s science fiction and fantasy stories often contain nostalgic elements related to his <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Midwestern childhood</span></b>. The Illinois community <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Green Town</span></b> is the setting of Bradbury\u2019s novels <i class=\"ygk-term\">Dandelion Wine</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>, both of which center on boys beginning to enter adulthood. Similarly, small towns on Earth and Mars are the setting of many stories in Bradbury\u2019s 1950 collection <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Martian Chronicles</i>, which is made up of loosely connected works about the expeditions of human <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">astronauts</span></b>, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">displacement of indigenous Martians</span></b> as human settlers arrive, and a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">nuclear war</span></b> that destroys most life on Earth.  Bradbury also wrote about Mars in several stories that appear in his collection <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Illustrated Man</i>, whose title character has <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tattoos</span></b> that foretell the future. Another theme that recurs in Bradbury\u2019s works is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">censorship</span></b> and the importance of literature. This theme is expressed most strongly in Bradbury\u2019s 1953 novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Fahrenheit 451</i>, which depicts a dystopian future in which <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cfiremen\u201d burn books</span></b>. The protagonist of <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Guy Montag</span></b>, a fireman whose wife <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mildred</span></b> is deeply depressed and addicted to television programs that she watches on large <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cparlor walls.\u201d</span></b> Montag begins to question his profession after meeting the free-spirited <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Clarisse McClellan</span></b>, and secretly preserves books to read, leading to a rebuke from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Fire Captain Beatty</span></b>. Montag is eventually pursued by a robotic attack dog called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cMechanical Hound,\u201d</span></b> but escapes to join a community of rebels who <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">memorize</span></b> classic works of literature.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Kurt Vonnegut</span></b> (1922\u20132007, United States). Vonnegut\u2019s fiction provides a darkly humorous response to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">absurdities and violence of the twentieth century</span></b>. During World War\u00a0II, Vonnegut was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">prisoner of war</span></b> in Germany, and lived through the Allied <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">firebombing of Dresden</span></b>. That experience was the basis for Vonnegut\u2019s novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, in which the soldier <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Billy Pilgrim</span></b> becomes <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cunstuck in time,\u201d</span></b> and perceives his life in a non-linear fashion. Billy travels between the present, past, and future as he is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">captured</span></b> by the German army, witnesses the destruction of Dresden, becomes a prosperous <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">optometrist</span></b> in the town of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ilium</span></b>, is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">kidnapped</span></b> by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">aliens</span></b> and placed in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">zoo</span></b> along with the actress <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Montana Wildhack</span></b>, and is eventually <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">assassinated</span></b>. <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> contains a number of elements that recur in other Vonnegut novels, including the veteran <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eliot Rosewater</span></b>, aliens from the planet <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tralfamadore</span></b>, the unsuccessful science fiction writer <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kilgore Trout</span></b>, and members of the wealthy <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rumfoord family</span></b>. Vonnegut also wrote the novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Cat\u2019s Cradle</i>, which describes a substance called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cice-nine\u201d</span></b> that instantly turns liquid water into a solid. Ice-nine was created by the atomic scientist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Felix Hoenikker</span></b>, whose life is researched by the novel\u2019s narrator, John. Another thread in <i>Cat\u2019s Cradle</i> concerns the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cbittersweet lies\u201d</span></b> of the prophet <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bokonon</span></b>, who lives on the Caribbean island <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">San Lorenzo</span></b>. Bokonon comments on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">human stupidity</span></b> after an accident that occurs during the funeral of the San Lorenzan dictator <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Papa Monzano</span></b> causes ice-nine to fall into the ocean, destroying almost all life on Earth.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Margaret Atwood</span></b> (1939\u2013present, Canada). One of Canada\u2019s most prominent authors of literary fiction, Atwood has written multiple works that combine speculative elements with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">psychological realism</span></b>. In 1985 Atwood published <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</i>, which portrays a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dystopian</span></b> near-future in which the United States has been replaced by the patriarchal <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Republic of Gilead</span></b>. <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</i> is narrated by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Offred</span></b>, whose role as a \u201chandmaid\u201d is to bear children for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cthe Commander\u201d</span></b> and his wife, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Serena Joy</span></b>. Offred flees her oppressive existence with the help of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nick</span></b>, a chauffeur who claims to be a member of the underground <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mayday</span></b> resistance movement. In an epilogue set in the year 2195, the archivist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Professor Pieixoto</span></b> discusses Offred\u2019s unknown fate. Atwood later wrote a trilogy set in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">post-apocalyptic</span></b> world where corporations have created <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bioengineered diseases</span></b> and people (<i class=\"ygk-term\">Oryx and Crake</i>, <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Year of the Flood</i>, and <i class=\"ygk-term\">MaddAddam</i>). In addition to her speculative works, Atwood has also written <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">historical fiction</span></b> (<i class=\"ygk-term\">Alias Grace</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Blind Assassin</i>, the latter of which contains a character who is a science fiction author), novels about the relationships between female friends (<i class=\"ygk-term\">Cat\u2019s Eye</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Robber Bride</i>), and a retelling of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Homer</span></b>\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Odyssey</span></b> from a female point of view (<i class=\"ygk-term\">The Penelopiad</i>).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Douglas Adams</span></b> (1952\u20132001, United Kingdom). Adams wrote <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">comic science fiction and fantasy novels</span></b> that poked fun at genre tropes and the quirks of British culture. After working on <i class=\"ygk-term\">Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus</i>, Adams created the BBC radio series <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy</i>, which premiered in 1978. The radio series became the basis of a series of novels (<i>The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy</i>; <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</i>; <i class=\"ygk-term\">Life, the Universe, and Everything</i>; <i class=\"ygk-term\">So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish</i>; <i class=\"ygk-term\">Mostly Harmless</i>; and the authorized sequel <i class=\"ygk-term\">And Another Thing\u2026</i>, which was written by <i class=\"ygk-term\">Artemis Fowl</i> author <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eoin Colfer</span></b> after Adams died). The <i class=\"ygk-term\">Hitchhiker\u2019s</i> series focuses on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Arthur Dent</span></b>, an ordinary Englishman who becomes one of the last humans in the universe after Earth is destroyed by the alien <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Vogons</span></b>. Arthur and his friend <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ford Prefect</span></b> travel on a starship named the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Heart of Gold</i>, along with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cparanoid android\u201d</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Marvin</span></b>, the two-headed galactic president <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zaphod Beeblebrox</span></b>, and the human scientist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Trillian</span></b>. Arthur eventually discovers that \u201canswer to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything</span></b>\u201d is 42 (although the question itself remains unknown). Characters in the <i>Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy</i> series sometimes consult the title reference work, which offers the advice <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cDon\u2019t Panic,\u201d</span></b> encourages hitchhikers to carry <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">towels</span></b> at all times, and provides the recipe for a drink called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cPan Galactic Gargle Blaster.\u201d</span></b> Besides the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Hitchhiker\u2019s</i> series, Adams also co-authored two books offering comic definitions of British place names (<i class=\"ygk-term\">The Meaning of Liff</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Deeper Meaning of Liff</i>), and wrote a pair of novels about the supernatural adventures of the private investigator Dirk Gently (<i class=\"ygk-term\">Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul</i>).</li>"

Not only has this phrase has been used in extremely varied contexts, but it is also followed by another phrase that, in altered form, has become a common Judeo-Christian credo: \u201cfor dust you are, and to dust you will return,\u201d which is typically shortened to \u201c(from) dust to dust.\u201d\r\n\t</li>",

Its passage of origin describes the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the two \u201ccities of the plain\u201d whose residents were so sinful (Sodom is the etymological source of the word \u201csodomy\u201d) that God rained brimstone (sulfur) and fire to obliterate them for mistreating Lot and his family. This phrase also appears in Revelation, which describes the \u201clake which burneth with fire and brimstone\u201d where the souls of sinners die a \u201csecond death.\u201d\r\n\t</li>",
                "<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">a land of milk and honey</span></b>, from Leviticus\u00a020:24, among others: \u201cBut I said to you, \u2018You will possess their land; I will give it to you as an inheritance, a land flowing with milk and honey.\u2019 I am the Lord your God, who has set you apart from the nations.\u201d\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tMentioned at least four times in the Old Testament, a \u201cland flowing with milk and honey\u201d is the homeland bestowed by God upon the Hebrews. It is the same place as \u201cthe promised land,\u201d an epithet derived from the word \u201cpromise\u201d in Deuteronomy 6:3 (which also uses the \u201cmilk and honey\u201d descriptor), and is now used in common parlance to identify any land of plenty. The phrase first appears in Exodus 3:8 when God\u0097in the form of the burning bush\u0097 promises to lead Moses to a \u201cland flowing with milk and honey.\u201d\r\n\t</li>",
                "<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">golden calf</span></b>, from Exodus\u00a032:2\u20134: \u201cAaron answered them, \u2018Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons, and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.\u2019 \u2026 He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, \u2018These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.\u2019\u201d\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tAaron is the older brother of Moses who, while Moses spends 40 days and 40 nights up on Mt. Sinai receiving the Ten Commandments from God, grows impatient and (against God\u2019s will) forges a golden calf to worship; when Moses sees the idol, he throws down and shatters the commandment tablets. Today, a metaphorical \u201cgolden calf\u201d is any object of desire or ambition that is regarded as immoral or ungenuine\u0097for this reason, Charging Bull, the bronze statue of a bull in New York City that symbolizes Wall Street, is held up as both a literal and figurative golden calf by critics of capitalism.\r\n\t</li>",
                "<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Jezebel</span></b>, from 1\u00a0Kings\u00a016 (throughout)\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tNo one exact Biblical passage accounts for the modern usage of the term \u201cJezebel\u201d to mean a brazenly promiscuous and devious woman; this usage derives from interpretation of her story as a whole. Jezebel, a pagan, married King Ahab and used her influence as queen to diminish worship of Yahweh in Israel, threaten the prophet Elijah, and help Ahab kill a vineyard owner. For these actions, Elijah prophesied Ahab\u2019s death, as well as Jezebel\u2019s (namely, that she would be eaten by dogs). Jezebel\u2019s reputation as wanton seems to primarily derive from how, upon seeing Jehu (an enemy commander) marching on the palace, Jezebel put on make-up and jewelry to either taunt him, seduce him, or simply look regal. This was her final act; Jehu ordered eunuchs to push Jezebel from her window, where she fell into the street and had her flesh devoured by dogs.\r\n\t</li>",
                "<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Behemoth</span></b>, from Job\u00a040:15\u201318: \u201cLook at Behemoth, which I made along with you\u2026. What strength it has in its loins, what power in the muscles of its belly! \u2026 Its bones are tubes of bronze, its limbs like rods of iron.\u201d\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tDepending on translation, the monster Behemoth either was the first or the mightiest thing God created. Near the end of the Book of Job (which concerns a wager between God and Satan to see if God\u2019s most righteous believer, Job, will lose his faith if deprived of all pleasure and comfort), Job begins cursing God. God appears as a storm and asserts that He alone created order out of chaos and that Job knows nothing. At the end a long speech about His power, God shows Job both Behemoth and the monster Leviathan to prove his ultimate power and wisdom. Behemoth, thus, has come to mean any unbeatable foe or gigantic entity.\r\n\t</li>",

The king watched the hand as it wrote.\u201d\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tBelshazzar was a king of Babylon whose sin and theft from Jerusalem\u2019s First Temple doomed him. At a feast, the hand of God appeared and wrote out a blazing message on the wall. The prophet Daniel alone could read God\u2019s message: Belshazzar\u2019s soul was wicked, his death had been arranged, and his kingdom would be conquered. So rarely was God\u2019s plan for a human made so public; \u201cseeing the writing on the wall\u201d has become an idiom for recognizing the obvious signs of an imminent outcome (especially a terrible one).\r\n\t</li>",

A similar message appears later in Matthew in the form of another common idiom: Jesus advises followers \u201cshake the dust from your feet\u201d when leaving places where their preaching goes unheeded. Both phrases have lost their religious overtones in regular usage: \u201cpearls before swine\u201d identifies something valuable or beautiful that goes unappreciated, while \u201cshaking the dust from your feet\u201d often describes an ambitious person moving out of a small town.\r\n\t</li>",

The emphasis in the parable is that the Samaritan is good despite Samaritans\u2019 general hatred of Jews; the parable is created by Jesus to answer the question of who is truly a man\u2019s neighbor, the implicit answer being every man. The directness of the parable has left its original sense wholly intact: today, a \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d is someone who stops to help, regardless of circumstance or inconvenience.\r\n\t</li>",
                "<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">ye of little faith</span></b>, from Matthew\u00a06:30, \u201cIf God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?\u201d\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tUttered in modern English in response to doubters and critics, this phrase occurs in the context of a passage known as \u201cThe Lilies of the Field\u201d or \u201cThe Birds of the Air\u201d in another section of Jesus\u2019s Sermon on the Mount. To comfort those who worry about survival and day-to-day life, Jesus tells his followers, \u201cConsider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin. And yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\u201d Thus, Jesus claims that if a person devotes themself to God, they must trust that God will eventually reward and protect them. Today, the phrase is often used outside of any religious context, as a (sometimes sarcastic) rebuke.\r\n\t</li>"

Abraham then makes a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">covenant</span></b> with the Lord, who promises that his descendants will be as numerous as the stars of the sky and the sands of the seashore. In Islamic tradition, Abraham (known as Ibrahim) is instead told to sacrifice his son Ishmael, whose mother is the concubine Hagar. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are collectively known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Abrahamic religions</span></b> due to Abraham\u2019s central role in the scriptures of all three.</li>",

While traveling to his uncle Laban to escape Esau\u2019s wrath, he has a vision of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">angels moving up and down a ladder to heaven</span></b>.

After killing an Egyptian overseer, he flees to the land of Midian, where the Lord appears to him in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">burning bush</span></b>. Moses and his brother <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aaron</span></b> go before the pharaoh to request he release the Israelites from bondage. When the pharaoh refuses, the Lord afflicts Egypt with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ten Plagues</span></b>, the last of which causes the death of every first-born male child.

Moses then leads the Israelites out of Egypt by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">parting the Red Sea</span></b>, after which they spend 40\u00a0years wandering in the desert. Moses receives the tablets of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ten Commandments</span></b> from the Lord on Mount Sinai, but smashes them in anger when he sees the people worshipping a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">golden calf</span></b>. Moses dies before entering the Promised Land and is succeeded by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joshua</span></b> as the leader of the Israelites. Since the books of the Jewish Torah (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) are attributed to Moses, the rules set forth in the Torah are known as the Mosaic Law.</li>",

After falling in love with a Philistine woman and preparing to marry her, Samson tells the groomsmen a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">riddle</span></b> involving honey in the carcass of a lion; the groomsmen force his betrothed to tell them the answer. Samson\u2019s betrothed is eventually married to another man, causing an enraged Samson to burn the Philistines\u2019 crops and slay 1,000 men with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">jawbone of a donkey</span></b>.

Samuel\u2019s mother, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hannah</span></b>, prays to the Lord for a child, and promises that should she conceive a son she will dedicate him to the service of the Lord. Shortly thereafter, Hannah becomes pregnant with Samuel. When Samuel is a young boy, the Lord calls to him during the night, though he mistakes the voice for that of the head priest <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eli</span></b>, whose downfall he subsequently foretells. As an adult, Samuel leads Israel to a major victory over the Philistines at Mizpah, erecting the stone Ebenezer on the site. At the Israelites\u2019 request, he <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">anoints Saul</span></b> as the first king of Israel; Saul eventually loses his favor by sparing King Agag of the Amalekites in battle. After Samuel\u2019s death, Saul calls upon the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Witch of Endor</span></b> to summon up Samuel\u2019s ghost; Samuel\u2019s spirit predicts a crushing defeat for Israel at the hands of the Philistines.</li>",

David first takes command of Israel\u2019s army after he uses a simple sling to slay the massive Philistine champion <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Goliath</span></b>, an event depicted in sculpture by Michelangelo and Donatello, among others. Though Saul becomes jealous of David and tries to kill him, David escapes with the help of Saul\u2019s son <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jonathan</span></b>, with whom he shares a deep relationship that some modern scholars have interpreted as romantic. As king, David captures the city of Jerusalem and installs the Ark of the Covenant there.

The nose belongs to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Major Kovalyov</span></b>, who wakes up the same day to find a smooth patch of skin where his nose used to be. Upon encountering his missing nose, which is traveling in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">carriage</span></b> and wearing the uniform of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">state councillor</span></b>, Kovalyov chases it to a shopping center called the Gostiny Dvor. There, Kovalyov wonders how to approach the nose, since its uniform indicates that it has a higher status than him. Summoning his courage, Kovalyov tries to convince the nose to return to his face, but the nose claims not to recognize him. Kovalyov goes to a newspaper, intending to offer a reward for the nose\u2019s return, but the clerk refuses his absurd-sounding request. Kovalyov then speaks with the police, who later catch the nose attempting to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">flee to Riga</span></b>. However, the doctor that Kovalyov consults is unable to re-attach the nose, even with an operation. Kovalyov writes a letter to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Madame Alexandra Podtochina Grigorievna</span></b>, accusing her of cursing him so that he will marry her daughter, but receives an uncomprehending reply.

Posdnicheff recalls the dissipations of his bachelor days before explaining how he courted his wife, whom he accuses of trapping him into marriage with her physical charms. According to Posdnicheff, the idleness of the well-fed upper classes leads to an unhealthy emphasis on romance, giving women power over men. He advocates the ideal of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">celibacy even in marriage</span></b>, astonishing the other train passengers. Posdnicheff describes quarrels with his wife, complaining that she was overly concerned with the health of their children, and that she eventually used <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">contraception</span></b>.

                "<li>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Polynomials</span></b> are functions made of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">terms</span></b> added together, in which each term is a number times a product of variables raised to nonnegative-integer powers.  For instance, 3<i>x</i><sup>2</sup><i>y</i> and \u2013\u03c0<i>x</i><sup>7</sup><i>y</i><sup>2</sup><i>z</i><sup>3</sup> are each terms, so 3<i>x</i><sup>2</sup><i>y</i>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u03c0<i>x</i><sup>7</sup><i>y</i><sup>2</sup><i>z</i><sup>3</sup> is a polynomial.  (Individual terms are also considered polynomials.)  Much of math is concerned with polynomials involving only one variable, such as \u2013<i>x</i><sup>3</sup>\u00a0+\u00a02<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>.  The number at the beginning of each term is called a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">coefficient</span></b>.</p>\n<p>Since simple numbers (\u201cconstants\u201d) can also be written as the same number times any variable to the zeroth power (that is, 6 is the same as 6<i>x</i><sup>0</sup>), numbers are also considered terms and polynomials.  So <i>x</i>\u00a0+\u00a06 is a polynomial, as is just \u20134.</p>\n<p>Polynomials can be classified according to their number of terms: a polynomial with one term, like 2<i>x</i> or \u201312<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, is called a <b><span class=\"label\">monomial</span></b>; a polynomial with two terms is called a <b><span class=\"label\">binomial</span></b>; and a polynomial with three terms is called a <b><span class=\"label\">trinomial</span></b>.</p>\n<p>Each polynomial has a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">degree</span></b>.  For polynomials of one variable, the degree is the largest exponent on the variable, so for the polynomial 4<i>x</i><sup>3</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, the degree is 3.  For polynomials of multiple variables, to find the degree you calculate the sum of the variables\u2019 exponents on each term, then choose the largest such sum, so the degree of 3<i>x</i><sup>6</sup><i>y</i><sup>5</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<i>x</i><sup>2</sup><i>y</i><sup>3</sup> is calculated by adding 6+5\u00a0=\u00a011 for the first term and 2+3\u00a0=\u00a05 for the second and noting that 11 is larger, so the degree is 11.  A polynomial that is just a constant has degree 0.  A polynomial with degree 1, like 3<i>x</i>, is called <b><span class=\"label\">linear</span></b>; a polynomial with degree 2, like 3<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a08x\u00a0+\u00a04, is called <b><span class=\"label\">quadratic</span></b>; a polynomial with degree 3 is called <b><span class=\"label\">cubic</span></b>; continuing with increasing degrees, the terms are <b><span class=\"label\">quartic</span></b>, <b><span class=\"label\">quintic</span></b>, <b><span class=\"label\">sextic</span></b>, and so on, though terms corresponding to degrees larger than 5 are seldom used.  For technical reasons that are beyond the scope of this article, the zero polynomial (i.e., <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a00) is said to have a degree of \u2013\u221e or an undefined degree.</p>\n<p>The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fundamental theorem of algebra</span></b> is the statement that every single-variable polynomial, other than constants, has a root in the complex numbers, which means that if <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) is a polynomial, then the equation <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a00 has at least one solution where <i>x</i> is some complex number.</p>\n<p>There are formulas to find those roots for linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic polynomials, though the latter two formulas are extremely complicated.  The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Abel-Ruffini theorem</span></b>, also called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Abel\u2019s impossibility theorem</span></b>, is the statement that there is no way to find a formula for the solutions of all quintic or higher-degree polynomials, if the formula must be based on the traditional operations (addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, and exponentiation/taking roots).  That impossibility is the topic that began an area of study called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Galois <b><span class=\"pg\">gal-wah</span></b> theory</span></b>, which is part of abstract algebra.</p>\n</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Quadratics</span></b> are, as mentioned above, polynomials of degree 2.  The graph of a quadratic equation will be in the shape of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">parabola</span></b> that opens straight up (if the coefficient on the <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> term is positive) or straight down (if that coefficient is negative).  It is possible to find the roots of a quadratic by graphing it, factoring it, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">completing the square</span></b> on it, or using the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quadratic formula</span></b> (itself derived by completing the square) on it.  If the quadratic is in the form <i>a</i><i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0+\u00a0<i>b</i><i>x</i>\u00a0+\u00a0<i>c</i>, then the expression <i>b</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a04<i>a</i><i>c</i>, which appears in the quadratic formula, is called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">discriminant</span></b>.  If the discriminant is positive, the quadratic will have two real roots; if the discriminant is zero, the quadratic will have one real root (said to have a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">multiplicity</span></b> of 2); and if the discriminant is negative, the quadratic will have two non-real complex roots (and if the coefficients of the quadratic are real numbers, the complex roots will be <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">conjugates</span></b> of each other).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Rational functions</span></b> consist of one polynomial divided by another polynomial.  The denominator polynomial cannot be the zero polynomial, because dividing by zero is undefined. Examples therefore include 1/<i>x</i>, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>/(<i>x</i>\u00a0\u2013\u00a03), and (<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0+\u00a01)/(<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a01).  Every polynomial can be considered to be a rational function because 1 is a polynomial and dividing by 1 doesn\u2019t change an expression (so to consider the polynomial <i>x</i><sup>3</sup> as a rational function, think of it as <i>x</i><sup>3</sup>/1).  It is often instructive to study the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">asymptotes</span></b> of rational functions, which are places in which their graphs approach a line (or occasionally other shape), usually getting infinitely close to but not crossing it.  That analysis may require performing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">long division</span></b> on the numerator and denominator polynomials to find their <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">greatest common factor</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Periodic functions</span></b> are those whose graph repeats a pattern (specifically, the graph has <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">translational symmetry</span></b>).  Technically speaking, a function of one variable <i>f</i> is periodic if <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>+<i>p</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) for every <i>x</i> in the domain of the function and some positive number <i>p</i>, which is called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">period</span></b>, because the graph repeats itself every <i>p</i>\u00a0units.  While the trigonometric functions are the periodic functions most commonly encountered by high school math students, some other functions like triangle waves are also periodic; in general, functions representing waves tend to be periodic.  A <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Fourier <b><span class=\"pg\">fur-ee-ay</span></b> series</span></b> is a way to rewrite (almost) any periodic function in terms of only sine and cosine functions.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">trigonometric functions</span></b> represent relations between angles and sides of triangles.  They are often illustrated using points and segments related to a circle of radius\u00a01 centered at the origin, called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unit circle</span></b>.  By far the most commonly discussed trigonometric functions are the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sine</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cosine</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tangent</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cosecant</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">secant</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cotangent</span></b> functions.  There are <i>many</i> interesting relationships between these: the graphs of sine and cosine are translations of each other; the tangent function equals the sine function divided by the cosine function; the cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions are the reciprocals of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions, respectively; and there are many other relationships called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">trigonometric identities</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">inverse trigonometric functions</span></b> are, as one might expect, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">inverse functions</span></b> of the trigonometric functions.  (Note that \u201cinverse\u201d in this case refers to a function that \u201cundoes\u201d another, not to \u201cmultiplicative inverse,\u201d also called \u201creciprocal.\u201d)  They are sometimes just called \u201cinverse sine,\u201d etc, and are also given with the prefix \u201carc\u201d: <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arcsine</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arccosine</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arctangent</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arccosecant</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arcsecant</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arccotangent</span></b>.  They are sometimes notated in the form sin<sup>\u20131</sup> for arcsine, but that notation can be confusing, so NAQT tends to prefer \u201carcsine,\u201d etc.  Because the trigonometric functions are not bijective (see below), to have inverses it is necessary to restrict the domains of the inverse trigonometric functions; for instance, arcsin(<i>x</i>) is only defined for <i>x</i> between \u20131 and 1, inclusive.</li>",
                "<li>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Injective functions</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"label\">injections</span></b>, are functions that do not repeat any outputs.  For instance, <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a02<i>x</i> is injective, because for every possible output value, there is only one input that will result in that output.  On the other hand, <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0sin(<i>x</i>) is <em>not</em> injective, because (for instance) the output 0 can be obtained from several different inputs (0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, and so on).  If you have the graph of a function, you can determine whether the function is injective by applying the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">horizontal line test</span></b>:  if no horizontal line would ever intersect the graph twice, the function is injective.</p>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Surjective functions</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"label\">surjections</span></b>, are functions that achieve every possible output.  For instance, if you are thinking of functions whose domain and codomain are both the set of all real numbers, then <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0tan(<i>x</i>) is surjective, because every real number is an output for some input.  But <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> is not surjective, because (for instance) \u20133 is not an output for any real-number input.  The term <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">image</span></b> is sometimes used for the set of all output values that a function actually achieves; a surjective function, then, is one whose image equals its codomain.</p>\n<p>A function that is both injective and surjective is called <b><span class=\"label\">bijective</span></b>, or a <b><span class=\"label\">bijection</span></b>.

For example, 80 = 2<sup>4</sup>\u00b75, and there is no other way to express 80 as a product of primes other than changing the order (80 = 5\u00b72<sup>4</sup> = 2<sup>3</sup>\u00b75\u00b72, etc., but these are all really the same product). This includes prime numbers as a \u201cproduct of just one prime,\u201d e.g., 7\u2019s prime factorization is just 7. This ubiquitous result in number theory is a principal reason that primes are so important.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">There are infinitely many prime numbers.</span></b> This is sometimes called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Euclid\u2019s theorem</span></b> since Euclid\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Elements</i> contained a proof of it similar to the following: Consider finitely many prime numbers <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>, \u2026 <i>p</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>. Now consider 1 more than the product of those prime numbers, that is, <i>p</i><sub>1</sub><i>p</i><sub>2</sub>\u00d7&amp;ctdot;\u00d7<i>p</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>\u2009+\u20091. That number cannot be divisible by any of the original prime numbers <i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>. Therefore, it must itself be prime, or else be divisible by prime numbers that are not on the original list. Either way, that means there is at least one prime number not on the original list. That argument can be applied to <em>any</em> finite list of prime numbers, so there cannot be any finite list that contains every prime number. There are many other proofs of this statement.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Fermat\u2019s little theorem</span></b> (not to be confused with Fermat\u2019s last theorem) states that if <i>p</i> is prime and <i>a</i> is any integer, then <i>a</i><sup><i>p</i></sup>\u00a0\u2261\u00a0<i>a</i>\u00a0mod\u2009<i>p</i>, that is, <i>a</i><sup><i>p</i></sup>\u2009\u2212\u2009<i>a</i> is divisible by <i>p</i>. This theorem is used in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">probabilistic primality testing</span></b>, which is problematic because the converse is not always true: <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Carmichael numbers</span></b> (of which 561 is the smallest example) are composite numbers <i>n</i> such that if <i>a</i> is any integer, <i>a</i><sup><i>n</i></sup>\u00a0\u2261\u00a0<i>a</i>\u00a0mod\u2009<i>n</i>.

Though named after the 18th-century English mathematician John Wilson, its first known use is by the 11th-century polymath Ibn\u00a0Al-Haytham.

(The theorem says nothing about odd perfect numbers, but it is not known whether any odd perfect numbers even exist.)</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The prime number theorem</span></b> describes the approximate behavior of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">prime counting function</span></b>, <i>\u03c0</i>(<i>n</i>), which gives the number of primes less than or equal to <i>n</i>.

Because of differences between the Gregorian and Jewish calendar, Rosh HaShanah may fall anywhere between September\u00a05 and October\u00a05. Rosh HaShanah services often include 100 soundings of the <i class=\"ygk-term\">shofar</i>, or ram\u2019s horn, and in many communities people may gather by bodies of water to perform the ritual of <i class=\"ygk-term\">tashlikh</i>, or the casting off of sins (represented by breadcrumbs or the like) into water. A popular treat on Rosh HaShanah is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">apples dipped in honey</span></b>, symbolizing hopes for a sweet and pleasant year. There are actually several other notions of the new year in Judaism; most notably, Nissan is often considered the first month because that is the month in which the exodus from Egypt took place, and the holiday Tu\u00a0B\u2019Sh\u2019vat is considered the new year for trees.</li>",

On the second and third days of T\u1ebft, people traditionally visit <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">friends and teachers</span></b>, respectively. Traditional foods for T\u1ebft include <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">b\u00e1nh chung</span></b>, a rice cake legendarily invented by a Hung prince to win the throne.

Exhibitors included <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Samuel Colt</span></b>, who brought a prototype of his \u201cNavy\u201d pistol, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mathew Brady</span></b>, a pioneer of daguerreotypes. A boating race held in conjunction with the exhibition was won by a ship called <i>America</i>, leading to its prize becoming known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">America\u2019s Cup</span></b>. It also featured the world\u2019s first modern <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pay toilets</span></b>, which cost a penny to use. The Crystal Palace remained in use for decades after the event was over, but was destroyed by a fire in 1936.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Paris, 1889: Exposition Universelle</span></b> Although Paris had hosted the World\u2019s Fair three times before, its 1889 event was easily its most iconic. It is best known for its centerpiece, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eiffel Tower</span></b>, which was by far the tallest structure in the world when it was completed. Exhibits were placed throughout the Champ de Mars, including the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cStreets of Cairo,\u201d</span></b> an elaborate interpretation of Egypt\u2019s capital. Another of its most popular attractions was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201chuman zoo,\u201d</span></b> in which various indigenous and other non-white people were put on display, a practice that was largely accepted at the time. The Eiffel Tower was scheduled to be dismantled 20 years after the 1889 fair, but its usefulness in telegraphy led to those plans being scrapped.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Chicago, 1893: World\u2019s Columbian Exposition</span></b> Chicago\u2019s 1893 fair was nicknamed the \u201cColumbian Exposition\u201d to honor the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus\u2019s voyages to the \u201cNew World.\u201d A massive pool representing Columbus\u2019s voyage served as its centerpiece. Other debuts at the fair included the first <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ferris Wheel</span></b>, the first chocolate <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">brownies</span></b>, and the first <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201csquished penny\u201d souvenirs</span></b>. The event is also associated with multiple controversies. Chicago mayor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Carter Harrison</span></b> was assassinated during its final days, leading to the cancellation of the closing ceremony. Additionally, serial killer <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">H.\u00a0H. Holmes</span></b> and his so-called \u201cMurder Castle\u201d are often tied to the fair, though their actual connection is likely minimal. Both the fair and the associated crimes are detailed in Erik Larson\u2019s book <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Devil in the White City</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">St.\u00a0Louis, 1904: Louisiana Purchase Exposition</span></b> The 1904 World\u2019s Fair was held to honor the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase. It saw the debut of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">X-ray machine</span></b> and inspired the popular song <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cMeet Me in St.\u00a0Louis, Louis.\u201d</span></b> The fair featured daily re-enactments of battles from the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Second Boer War</span></b>, many of which featured people who had actually fought in it. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">1904 Summer Olympics</span></b> had been awarded to Chicago but were re-located to St.\u00a0Louis so they could be held alongside the fair. That change led to very sparse attendance and poorly run events over the course of several months. Novelist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kate Chopin</span></b> suffered a brain hemorrhage while visiting the 1904 fair and died two days later.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Brussels, 1958</span></b> The first full-scale world\u2019s fair after World War\u00a0II was held in Brussels in 1958. A lasting symbol of the Brussels fair is the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Atomium</span></b>, a 335-foot model of a unit cell of an iron crystal. The structure, which remains among the city\u2019s most popular attractions, is approximately 165 billion times larger than the cell it represents. The fair also featured the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Po\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique</i>, a piece of electronic music by Edgard Var\u00e8se played in a specialized pavilion designed by Le\u00a0Corbusier. The first universal poll to rank the greatest films was held at the Brussels fair, which was topped by Sergei Eisenstein\u2019s <i>Battleship Potemkin</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Seattle, 1962: Century 21</span></b> Because of the ongoing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">space race</span></b>, Seattle\u2019s fair had a strong focus on technology and aerospace. Structures built for the fair include the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Space Needle</span></b> and a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">monorail</span></b>, both of which are still standing today. Its \u201cWorld of Science\u201d building housed the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Project Mercury capsule</span></b> that took Alan Shepard to space, and its \u201cWorld of Century 21\u201d building offered glimpses of \u201cthe future\u201d of cities, cars, and air travel. John F. Kennedy intended to attend the closing of the fair, but was unable to because of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The fairgrounds, now known as the Seattle Center, has since become home to the Museum of Pop Culture.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">New York, 1964</span></b> Like the Seattle fair two years earlier, the New York fair was themed around the burgeoning <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Space Age</span></b>, particularly with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Unisphere</span></b>, a massive stainless-steel globe that served as a key symbol of the event. Pope John\u00a0XXIII allowed Michelangelo\u2019s <i>Piet\u00e0</i> to be relocated to the fair\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Vatican Pavilion</span></b>. Elsewhere, Walt Disney designed several animatronic attractions for the fair, including his first incarnation of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cIt\u2019s a Small World\u201d</span></b> ride. While it is generally named for 1964, the fair had a second \u201cseason\u201d the following year as well. A pair of observation towers left over from the fair provide a key plot point to the movie <i>Men in Black</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Montreal, 1967: Expo 67</span></b> Montreal hosted one of the biggest world fairs in history and attracted over half a million visitors just days after opening. One highlight of the fair was the unveiling of Moshe Safdie\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cHabitat 67,\u201d</span></b> a complex of hundreds of interlocking concrete buildings intended as a model community. The U.S. Pavilion at the fair was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">geodesic dome</span></b> designed by Buckminster Fuller, which was later converted into a museum called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Biosphere</span></b>. In a notorious moment, French president Charles de\u00a0Gaulle addressed a crowd in Montreal and declared <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cLong live a free Quebec!,\u201d</span></b> angering many Canadian politicians.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Knoxville, 1982</span></b> In contrast to larger \u201cWorld Expos,\u201d Knoxville held a \u201cspecialized\u201d fair focused on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">energy</span></b>. Structures built for the event include the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sunsphere</span></b>, a 266-foot tower topped with a golden sphere. The fair also featured the debut of an early version of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">touch screen</span></b> and the introduction of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cherry Coke</span></b>. American sports were also featured during the event, with the NFL and NBA both hosting exhibition games at local venues. A fictional version of the Sunsphere had a prominent role in an episode of <i>The Simpsons</i>, in which it was converted into the \u201cWigsphere,\u201d a shop for discount wigs.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Dubai, 2020</span></b> The most recent world fair was scheduled for Dubai in 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it ultimately began in September 2021. The U.S. built a 36,000-square-foot pavilion for the fair, which featured artifacts like <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thomas Jefferson\u2019s copy of the Qur\u2019an</span></b> and a moon rock from the Apollo\u00a017 mission. The fair also played host to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">2021 World Chess Championship</span></b>, which was won by defending champion Magnus Carlsen. Shortly before the fair began, the European Parliament formally <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">opposed</span></b> the event, citing the UAE\u2019s human rights record, though it had little effect on attendance.</li>"

His Paris premiere of <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Rite of Spring</i> (1913), however, is what inaugurated music\u2019s Modern era.  A pagan story featuring <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">polytonal music</span></b>, <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Rite of Spring</i> shocked the audience so much that riots ensued, leading a stunned Stravinsky to pursue rational, \"neoclassical\" music, such as his <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Symphony of Psalms</span></b>.  In 1940 he moved to Hollywood, where he composed his one full-length opera, <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Rake\u2019s Progress</i>, with libretto by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">W.\u00a0H.

Late in life, he adopted the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">serialist</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">twelve-tone style</span></b> of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Anton Webern</span></b>, producing the abstract ballet <i class=\"ygk-term\">Agon</i> (1957).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Arnold Schoenberg</span></b> (1874\u20131951).

Yet by 1912, with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sprechstimme</span></b> (halfway between singing and speaking) piece <i class=\"ygk-term\">Pierrot lunaire</i>, he broke from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Romanticism</span></b> and developed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">expressionist</span></b> pieces free from key or tone.  His students, especially <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Alban Berg</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Anton Webern</span></b>, further elaborated on his theories.  Fleeing Nazi persecution in 1933, he moved from Berlin to Los Angeles, where he completed <i class=\"ygk-term\">A Survivor from Warsaw</i>.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Scales</span></b>: The two most common types of scales are the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">major and minor scales</span></b>, both of which are referred to as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diatonic</span></b>, meaning that they have seven notes between octaves and follow a repeating pattern of whole steps and half steps. While there is only one major scale, there are three common variants of the minor scale: <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">natural</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">harmonic</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">melodic</span></b>. The individual notes within a scale are given numeric indications known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">scale degrees</span></b>, starting with \u201c1\u201d and moving up the scale note by note; the most prominent of these are the first degree, or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tonic</span></b> (the \u201chome\u201d pitch), and the fifth degree, or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dominant</span></b>. There is also the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">chromatic scale</span></b>, which includes every note between two endpoints, including sharps and flats.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Intervals</span></b>: At the most basic level, intervals \u2014 the distance between two pitches \u2014 are described with ordinal numbers (second, third, etc.), with the exceptions of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unisons</span></b> (two of the exact same note, which would logically have been called a \u201cfirst\u201d) and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">octaves</span></b> (which would have been called an \u201ceighth\u201d). The easiest way to find the basic interval between two pitches is to start on the bottom pitch, label that line or space \u201c1,\u201d and then count lines and spaces upwards until the next pitch is reached; for example, the interval between C and F is a fourth: C is counted as \u201c1,\u201d the lines/spaces for D and E are counted as \u201c2\u201d and \u201c3,\u201d and the line/space for F is reached on \u201c4.\u201d Unisons, fourths, fifths, and octaves may be classified as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">perfect</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">augmented</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diminished</span></b>; seconds, thirds, sixths, and sevenths may be classified as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">major</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">minor</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">augmented</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diminished</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Chords</span></b>: The most common types of chords are built of successive notes that are each a third above the previous. A <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">triad</span></b> consists of three notes referred to as the root, third, and fifth\u2014the third and fifth being that respective interval above the root. Triads are classified as either <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">major</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">minor</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">augmented</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diminished</span></b>, based on whether the successive pitches are separated by major or minor thirds. Adding another third above the fifth results in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">seventh chord</span></b> (since that new pitch is a seventh above the root). Although many types of seventh chords are possible, the most common are the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">major</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">major-minor</span></b> (or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dominant</span></b>), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">minor</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">half-diminished</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fully-diminished</span></b>. Larger chords, such as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ninth</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">thirteenth</span></b> chords, appear commonly in jazz.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Key</span></b>: A piece of music\u2019s key is the \u201chome\u201d scale of the work. The key is most often indicated by the work\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">key signature</span></b>, a collection of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sharps</span></b> or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">flats</span></b> that appears at the beginning of the work and on each subsequent line of music (a list of key signatures may be found <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signature#Table\">here</a>). A pair of keys may be <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">parallel</span></b> (beginning on the same pitch, e.g., C\u00a0major and C\u00a0minor), or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">relative</span></b> (having the same key signature, e.g., C\u00a0major and A\u00a0minor). Most works of music between the Baroque and Romantic periods end in the same key as they begin, with the exception that works that start in a minor key may end in the parallel major. A work\u2019s key is often used as a descriptor in its title (e.g. Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No.\u00a05 in C\u00a0minor).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Transposition</span></b>: Instruments that are in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">concert pitch</span></b>, or \u201cin C,\u201d have their music written at the same pitch in which they sound. Concert pitch instruments include the piano, all string instruments, the flute, and nearly every woodwind and brass instrument that plays in bass clef. Other instruments are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">transposing instruments</span></b>, meaning that their music is written at a different pitch than they sound. With few exceptions, music for transposing instruments is written <em>above</em> the sounding pitch, which can be determined by moving down the interval that the instrument\u2019s key is <em>below</em> C. For example, the French horn is in F, a perfect fifth below C; thus, a French horn playing a written G\u00a0natural would sound a C\u00a0natural, the pitch a perfect fifth below G\u00a0natural. Similarly, a B-flat trumpet playing a written D would sound a C, a major second below.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Dynamics</span></b>: Dynamic markings indicate the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">volume</span></b> at which music is to be played. The two most basic dynamic markings are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">forte</span></b>, meaning \u201cloud,\u201d and abbreviated <i class=\"ygk-term\">f</i>; and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">piano</span></b>, meaning \u201csoft,\u201d and abbreviated <i class=\"ygk-term\">p</i>. These indications are often modified by the word <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mezzo</span></b> (abbreviated <i class=\"ygk-term\">m</i>); thus, <i class=\"ygk-term\">mf</i> indicates \u201cmezzo forte,\u201d meaning \u201cmedium loud.\u201d They may also be modified by the suffix <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">-issimo</span></b>, meaning \u201cvery,\u201d and symbolized by two of the same letter; thus, <i class=\"ygk-term\">pp</i> would indicate <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pianissimo</span></b>, meaning \u201cvery soft.\u201d Gradual changes in volume are indicated by a <i class=\"ygk-term\">crescendo</i>, meaning gradually getting louder, or a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diminuendo</span></b> (also called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">decrescendo</span></b>), meaning gradually getting softer.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Articulation</span></b>: Articulation refers to the various techniques which may be used to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">modify</span></b> the attack or performance of a single note or a series of notes. Some of the most common articulations include <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">staccato</span></b>, meaning light or short; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tenuto</span></b>, meaning a note is to be held its entire value; and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">legato</span></b>, meaning a series of notes is to be connected to one another very smoothly. Single notes may be given extra force by an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">accent mark</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Form</span></b>: A work\u2019s form, or overall structure, is often depicted via a series of capital letters, with each different letter representing a large section of contrasting material. Basic forms include <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">binary form</span></b> (\u201cAB\u201d or \u201cAABB\u201d), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ternary form</span></b> (\u201cABA\u201d), and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">strophic form</span></b> (\u201cA\u201d endlessly repeated, commonly found in folk songs or religious hymns with multiple verses). Other forms include <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">rondo form</span></b>, in which several statements of a single theme are each separated by contrasting material (e.g. \u201cABACA\u201d). Forms not usually represented by capital letters include the various types of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">theme and variations</span></b>, as well as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sonata-allegro form</span></b> (which at its most basic level includes an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">exposition</span></b>, a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">development</span></b>, and a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">recapitulation</span></b>).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Twelve-tone technique</span></b>: Twelve-tone technique was developed by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Arnold Schoenberg</span></b> in the early 1920s, and is one method of writing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">atonal music</span></b>\u2014music that has <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">no key or tonic</span></b> pitch. Twelve-tone works are based on a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tone row</span></b> constructed from each of the twelve pitches of the chromatic scale, each used only once. This row may be inverted and/or presented in retrograde (backwards), a combination of possibilities often represented in a twelve-tone matrix (for an example, see <a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zhz8NEf3_04/TCd22VxuiOI/AAAAAAAAAHc/Yqo-JiBCCoo/s1600/Matrix.jpeg\">here</a>; curious readers may experiment with creating their own row/matrix <a href=\"https://www.musictheory.net/calculators/matrix\">here</a>). Twelve-tone technique is one form of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">serialism</span></b>, the rigid structuring of various musical elements within a work. A work of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">total serialism</span></b> applies the same process to dynamics, articulations, and other basic elements of music as well as pitch.</li>"

Often overshadowed by the ubiquitous first movement is the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">violent third movement</span></b>, a <i>Presto agitato</i> sonata-allegro form with an extended coda, which on a larger scale serves as a recapitulation for the entire sonata.

The sonata begins ominously: a theme descends in open octaves to the lowest note of the contemporary piano before rising again in an arpeggio, immediately repeated a\u00a0minor second higher. The second movement has no stable conclusion, instead directly leading to the third through the use of a diminished seventh chord.

Of the three, only No.\u00a039 in E\u00a0flat\u00a0major, K.\u00a0543, has a slow introduction;  unusually, it omits oboes entirely.  No.\u00a040 in G\u00a0minor, K.\u00a0550, on the other hand, was revised to reduce the oboe part and add clarinets; the last movement may have inspired the third movement of Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony.  No.\u00a041 in C\u00a0major, K.\u00a0551, probably got its nickname of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cJupiter\u201d</span></b> from Johann Peter Salomon. Its first movement quotes Mozart\u2019s aria <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cUn bacio di mano\u201d</span></b> (\u201cA kiss on her hand\u201d), composed for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pasquale Anfossi</span></b>\u2019s opera <i>Il curioso indiscreto</i>; its last movement presents five themes which are all brought together in a massive <i class=\"ygk-term\">fugato</i> at the end.</li>",

He was the son of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Alcmene</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zeus</span></b>, which earned him the lifelong enmity of Zeus\u2019s wife Hera. Hera struck Heracles with a temporary madness so that he killed his wife <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Megara</span></b> and their children. As penance, Heracles served <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">King Eurystheus</span></b> for ten years and completed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">twelve labors</span></b>. Some of his most famous labors were slaying the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nemean Lion</span></b>, whose skin was impenetrable; slaying the nine-headed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lernaean Hydra</span></b>, which would sprout new heads when one was cut off; redirecting two rivers to clean the massive <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Augean stables</span></b> in one day; and capturing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cerberus</span></b>, the three-headed guard dog of the Underworld. Heracles was killed when the centaur <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nessus</span></b> tricked Heracles\u2019s wife <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Deianira</span></b> into giving him a poisoned shirt. After his death, Heracles was deified and married the goddess of youth, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hebe</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Theseus</span></b> was a prince of Athens who was described as both the son of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">King Aegeus</span></b> and the son of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Poseidon</span></b>. He was raised by his mother <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aethra</span></b> in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Troezen</span></b>, then as a young man took a land journey back to Athens, during which he defeated six foes, including the bandits <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sinis, Sciron, and Procrustes</span></b>. After Theseus was sent by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Medea</span></b> to kill the Marathonian Bull, he voluntarily went to Crete to combat the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Minotaur</span></b>, a bull-headed monster who devoured the Athenian tributes demanded every nine years by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">King Minos</span></b>. Minos\u2019s daughter <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ariadne</span></b> gave Theseus a ball of string to help him navigate the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Labyrinth</span></b>, and he successfully slew the Minotaur. Theseus escaped with Ariadne, but later abandoned her on the island of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Naxos</span></b>. On the way back to Athens, Theseus forgot to replace the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">black sails</span></b> on his ship with white sails, which led his father King Aegeus to commit suicide because he believed Theseus had been killed.</li>",

On his way back to Seriphos, Perseus used the head of Medusa to rescue the Ethiopian princess <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Andromeda</span></b> from the sea monster <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cetus</span></b>. Perseus also killed Polydectes, whose advances on Dana\u00eb had turned violent in his absence.

In an attempt to kill Jason, Pelias offered him the throne if he completed a quest to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Colchis</span></b> and retrieved the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Golden Fleece</span></b>. Jason assembled a crew of heroes, named the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Argonauts</span></b> after their ship, the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Argo</i>, for the quest.

Jason abandoned Medea for the Corinthian princess <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Glauce</span></b>, and in revenge, Medea killed Glauce as well as her own children with Jason.

Thetis tried to keep Achilles out of the Trojan War by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">disguising him as a girl</span></b> on the island of Skyros, but his trickery was exposed by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Odysseus</span></b>. Achilles refused to continue fighting in the Trojan War after the Greek commander, Agamemnon, seized his concubine <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Briseis</span></b>. As the Trojans start to gain the upper hand, Achilles\u2019s friend (and, by many interpretations, lover) <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Patroclus</span></b> donned Achilles\u2019s armor and led his <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Myrmidon</span></b> warriors into battle. After Patroclus was killed by the Trojans\u2019 best warrior, Hector, Achilles flew into a berserk rage and massacred many of the remaining Trojans, including Hector. Achilles was eventually killed by the Trojan prince <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Paris</span></b>, who shot an arrow into Achilles\u2019s vulnerable heel.</li>",

Odysseus originally tried to avoid the war by pretending to be insane, but was exposed when <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Palamedes</span></b> put his son <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Telemachus</span></b> in front of his plow. During the war, Odysseus showcased his cunning by proposing the idea for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Trojan Horse</span></b>. Odysseus\u2019s ten-year journey home from the war is the subject of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Homer\u2019s <i>Odyssey</i></span></b>.

When Odysseus arrived back in Ithaca, he found that his loyal wife <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Penelope</span></b> was being harassed by rowdy suitors who believed him to be dead.

Diomedes and the other <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Epigoni</span></b> (the sons of the Seven) avenged their fathers by sacking and plundering Thebes.  During the Trojan War, Diomedes and Odysseus participated in a daring <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">night raid</span></b> on the Trojan camp. One Trojan warrior named <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Glaucus</span></b> challenged Diomedes to single combat, but after they realized that their grandfathers had been friends, they swapped armor instead of fighting. Diomedes was the only mortal other than Heracles to fight and injure gods, wounding both <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ares</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aphrodite</span></b>.

Ajax fought the premier Trojan warrior, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hector</span></b>, and wounded him, but the match was called a draw and Ajax gave Hector a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">purple sash</span></b> in exchange for Hector\u2019s sword. Ajax competed with Odysseus for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">armor of Achilles</span></b> after his death, but the armor was awarded to Odysseus.

To aid in his quest, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Athena</span></b> visited Bellerophon in a dream and gave him a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">golden bridle</span></b> with which he tamed the flying horse <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pegasus</span></b>. Bellerophon rode Pegasus up to the lair of the Chimera and threw a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">spear tipped with a block of lead</span></b> into its mouth; the monster\u2019s breath melted the lead, which suffocated it.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Skepticism</span></b> encourages the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">rejection of truths unless they are supported</span></b> by sufficient evidence. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Academic Skepticism</span></b>, which states that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">no truths can be certain</span></b>, was led by such men as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Arcesilaus</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Carneades</span></b>.  Another form of skepticism is known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cPyrrhonian,\u201d</span></b> after <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pyrrho of Elis</span></b>, who is considered the founder of skepticism.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Scholasticism</span></b> was taught at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">medieval Christian universities</span></b> and sought to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">reconcile Christian thought with classical thinkers</span></b> such as Aristotle.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Empiricism</span></b> is the view that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">all knowledge derives from sensory experience</span></b>.  <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Locke</span></b>, whose works include <i class=\"ygk-term\">An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</i>, thought that the mind starts out as a <i class=\"ygk-term\">tabula rasa</i> \u2014 (blank slate) and that we <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gain knowledge through experiences</span></b>.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Rationalism</span></b>, which is often <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">contrasted with empiricism</span></b>, asserts that we <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gain knowledge through intuition</span></b> or our rational nature rather than through experience.  A version of this doctrine was espoused by the Greek philosopher <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Plato</span></b> in his <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Theory of Forms</span></b>, which states that abstract ideas (\u201cforms\u201d) are more real than the material world of the senses.

Not only has this phrase has been used in extremely varied contexts, but it is also followed by another phrase that, in altered form, has become a common Judeo-Christian credo: \u201cfor dust you are, and to dust you will return,\u201d which is typically shortened to \u201c(from) dust to dust.\u201d\r\n\t</li>",

Its passage of origin describes the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the two \u201ccities of the plain\u201d whose residents were so sinful (Sodom is the etymological source of the word \u201csodomy\u201d) that God rained brimstone (sulfur) and fire to obliterate them for mistreating Lot and his family. This phrase also appears in Revelation, which describes the \u201clake which burneth with fire and brimstone\u201d where the souls of sinners die a \u201csecond death.\u201d\r\n\t</li>",

It is the same place as \u201cthe promised land,\u201d an epithet derived from the word \u201cpromise\u201d in Deuteronomy 6:3 (which also uses the \u201cmilk and honey\u201d descriptor), and is now used in common parlance to identify any land of plenty. The phrase first appears in Exodus 3:8 when God\u0097in the form of the burning bush\u0097 promises to lead Moses to a \u201cland flowing with milk and honey.\u201d\r\n\t</li>",

Jezebel, a pagan, married King Ahab and used her influence as queen to diminish worship of Yahweh in Israel, threaten the prophet Elijah, and help Ahab kill a vineyard owner. For these actions, Elijah prophesied Ahab\u2019s death, as well as Jezebel\u2019s (namely, that she would be eaten by dogs). Jezebel\u2019s reputation as wanton seems to primarily derive from how, upon seeing Jehu (an enemy commander) marching on the palace, Jezebel put on make-up and jewelry to either taunt him, seduce him, or simply look regal. This was her final act; Jehu ordered eunuchs to push Jezebel from her window, where she fell into the street and had her flesh devoured by dogs.\r\n\t</li>",

Near the end of the Book of Job (which concerns a wager between God and Satan to see if God\u2019s most righteous believer, Job, will lose his faith if deprived of all pleasure and comfort), Job begins cursing God. God appears as a storm and asserts that He alone created order out of chaos and that Job knows nothing.

The prophet Daniel alone could read God\u2019s message: Belshazzar\u2019s soul was wicked, his death had been arranged, and his kingdom would be conquered. So rarely was God\u2019s plan for a human made so public; \u201cseeing the writing on the wall\u201d has become an idiom for recognizing the obvious signs of an imminent outcome (especially a terrible one).\r\n\t</li>",

A similar message appears later in Matthew in the form of another common idiom: Jesus advises followers \u201cshake the dust from your feet\u201d when leaving places where their preaching goes unheeded. Both phrases have lost their religious overtones in regular usage: \u201cpearls before swine\u201d identifies something valuable or beautiful that goes unappreciated, while \u201cshaking the dust from your feet\u201d often describes an ambitious person moving out of a small town.\r\n\t</li>",

The emphasis in the parable is that the Samaritan is good despite Samaritans\u2019 general hatred of Jews; the parable is created by Jesus to answer the question of who is truly a man\u2019s neighbor, the implicit answer being every man. The directness of the parable has left its original sense wholly intact: today, a \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d is someone who stops to help, regardless of circumstance or inconvenience.\r\n\t</li>",

To comfort those who worry about survival and day-to-day life, Jesus tells his followers, \u201cConsider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin. And yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\u201d Thus, Jesus claims that if a person devotes themself to God, they must trust that God will eventually reward and protect them. Today, the phrase is often used outside of any religious context, as a (sometimes sarcastic) rebuke.\r\n\t</li>"

Moses receives the tablets of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ten Commandments</span></b> from the Lord on Mount Sinai, but smashes them in anger when he sees the people worshipping a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">golden calf</span></b>. Moses dies before entering the Promised Land and is succeeded by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joshua</span></b> as the leader of the Israelites.

After falling in love with a Philistine woman and preparing to marry her, Samson tells the groomsmen a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">riddle</span></b> involving honey in the carcass of a lion; the groomsmen force his betrothed to tell them the answer. Samson\u2019s betrothed is eventually married to another man, causing an enraged Samson to burn the Philistines\u2019 crops and slay 1,000 men with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">jawbone of a donkey</span></b>. Samson\u2019s downfall comes when he falls in love with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Delilah</span></b>, who seduces him for the secret of his strength, then cuts his hair while he is asleep. He is captured and blinded by the Philistines, who display him in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Temple of Dagon</span></b>.

Shortly thereafter, Hannah becomes pregnant with Samuel. When Samuel is a young boy, the Lord calls to him during the night, though he mistakes the voice for that of the head priest <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eli</span></b>, whose downfall he subsequently foretells. As an adult, Samuel leads Israel to a major victory over the Philistines at Mizpah, erecting the stone Ebenezer on the site. At the Israelites\u2019 request, he <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">anoints Saul</span></b> as the first king of Israel; Saul eventually loses his favor by sparing King Agag of the Amalekites in battle. After Samuel\u2019s death, Saul calls upon the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Witch of Endor</span></b> to summon up Samuel\u2019s ghost; Samuel\u2019s spirit predicts a crushing defeat for Israel at the hands of the Philistines.</li>",

Though Saul becomes jealous of David and tries to kill him, David escapes with the help of Saul\u2019s son <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jonathan</span></b>, with whom he shares a deep relationship that some modern scholars have interpreted as romantic. As king, David captures the city of Jerusalem and installs the Ark of the Covenant there. He falls in love with the married woman <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bathsheba</span></b> and sends her husband Uriah the Hittite to be killed in battle; this earns him a strong rebuke from the prophet Nathan. David\u2019s children include <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Absalom</span></b>, who leads a rebellion against him.

Under Solomon\u2019s rule, Israel built the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">First Temple of Jerusalem</span></b>, also known as the Temple of Solomon, whose innermost chamber housed the Ark of the Covenant. Solomon amassed great wealth and had 700 wives. In a short episode that inspired numerous artists, Solomon was visited by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Queen of Sheba</span></b>.

Daniel <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">interprets dreams</span></b> for the king, including one in which an enormous statue represents four successive kingdoms that will supplant Babylon, and another predicting that Nebuchadnezzar will suffer from seven years of madness. In one episode, Nebuchadnezzar casts Daniel\u2019s friends <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego</span></b> into a furnace, but all three emerge unscathed. Daniel also serves the later ruler <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Belshazzar</span></b> and interprets a mysterious hand that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">writes on the wall</span></b> during a feast, predicting Belshazzar\u2019s downfall\u2014which comes that night.

Jonah is cast overboard by the crew and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">swallowed by a large fish</span></b>, which spits him onto the shore after three days.

The word Shavuot means \u201cweeks,\u201d (seven weeks of the Omer), hence the name of the homologous Christian holiday <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pentecost</span></b>. Shavuot commemorates the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">giving of the Torah</span></b> to the Israelites at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mount Sinai</span></b>, as well as the beginning of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">harvest</span></b> in ancient Israel.

This practice derives from God\u2019s instruction to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Abraham</span></b>, after which Abraham circumcised himself and later circumcised his son <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Isaac</span></b>.

For girls, the same is done at a separate event, often (but not necessarily) during a regular synagogue service in the first few weeks of the baby\u2019s life. This tradition is primarily observed in more liberal Jewish movements and is not considered religiously required, so practices vary and are evolving. The Hebrew name is used on special occasions such as being called to the Torah and being married, and is typically in the form \u201cYitzchak ben Avraham\u201d (Isaac, son of Abraham) or (in egalitarian movements) \u201cYitzchak ben Avraham v\u2019Sarah\u201d (Isaac, son of Abraham and Sarah).</li>",

Although a <i>bar/bat mitzvah</i> occurs upon the birthday regardless of whether any ceremony takes place, traditionally the occasion is marked at a service at the synagogue around that time; the honoree will wear a <i class=\"ygk-term\">tallit</i> (prayer shawl) for the first time, be called up for an honor (<i class=\"ygk-term\">aliyah</i>) for the first time, read from the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Torah</i> (first five books of the Bible) and <i class=\"ygk-term\">haftarah</i> (a portion of one of the prophets\u2019 books, linked to the week\u2019s Torah portion), and give a <i class=\"ygk-term\">d\u2019var Torah</i>, a discourse on the meaning of the week\u2019s Torah portion. A celebratory meal or party often follows.  The <i>bar mitzvah</i> for boys dates back to ancient times in varying forms; the <i>bat mitzvah</i> mainly arose in the 20th century. After becoming <i>bar mitzvah</i>, a man is responsible for fulfilling the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">613 commandments</span></b> in the Torah and may be counted toward a <i class=\"ygk-term\">minyan</i> (quorum required for certain prayers); in egalitarian movements the same applies to a woman who has become <i>bat mitzvah</i>.</li>",

In egalitarian movements the wording is adjusted and the bride and groom also sign. The <i>ketubah</i> is frequently a beautiful, illuminated document, and the couple will often display it in their home.</p>\n<p>The wedding ceremony takes place under a <i class=\"ygk-term\">chuppah</i>, a canopy supported on four poles, symbolizing the couple\u2019s home. The bride\u2019s face is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">veiled</span></b>\u2014recalling Genesis, in which Laban tricked Jacob into marrying Leah rather than Rachel by having the bride veiled at the ceremony, but to prevent such an occurrence, the groom removes the veil to verify that he will marry the correct person.

The groom presents the bride with an object of value (typically a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ring</span></b>), and in egalitarian weddings, vice versa. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Seven blessings</span></b> (Hebrew: <i class=\"ygk-term\">sheva b\u2019rachot</i>) formalize the marriage. The groom <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">breaks a glass</span></b> (or in egalitarian movements, the bride and groom may break a glass together) to remind the community that even at a joyous occasion there is still sorrow (particularly with respect to the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem).</p>\n<p>The wedding is followed by a festive meal and party. Dancing is common, especially the <i class=\"ygk-term\">hora</i>, and it is traditional to lift the bride and groom on chairs. Traditionally, a special version of <i class=\"ygk-term\">birkat ha-mazon</i> (grace after meals) is recited.</p>\n</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Divorce</span></b> is discouraged, but permitted, in Judaism. It is effected by a document called a <i class=\"ygk-term\">get</i>. By Jewish law, a husband must present a wife with a <i>get</i> of his own free will, and traditionally (but not by law) she must choose to accept it. The former presents an obvious problem when a wife wishes to be divorced but her husband does not. This is a considerable problem in observant Jewish communities and has led to a variety of attempted solutions of varying acceptance and effectiveness (usually in the form of some sort of prenuptial agreement, but occasionally <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/10/rabbis-fbi-divorce-sting/2959369/\">more creative, less legal forms</a>).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Death.</span></b> A deceased person\u2019s body is not embalmed; rather, it is ritually washed by members of a group called the <i class=\"ygk-term\">chevra kadisha</i> (literally \u201choly society\u201d), who then dress the body in a simple linen garment (<i class=\"ygk-term\">tachrich</i>), place it in a simple <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">wooden casket</span></b> (no metal, so that the body\u2019s return to dust is hastened), and stay with the deceased while reciting psalms. At the funeral, there is no viewing. Eulogies may be given, and mourners may recite psalms (especially <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Psalm\u00a023</span></b>, \u201cThe Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want) and <i class=\"ygk-term\">El Malei Rachamim</i> (\u201cGod, full of mercy\u201d). Cremation is forbidden, and burial should take place as soon as possible. At the burial, mourners take turns <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">shoveling dirt</span></b> into the grave, but do not pass the shovel directly to one another. A common myth states that having a tattoo prevents one from being buried in a Jewish cemetery; though Judaism discourages tattoos, that is not true. Proper treatment of the dead is considered a critical <i class=\"ygk-term\">mitzvah</i> (both commandment and good deed) because the beneficiary (the deceased person) cannot offer repayment or express gratitude.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Mourning</span></b> commences immediately upon hearing of a death, when one traditionally recites a blessing that translates to \u201cBlessed are you, Lord our God, king of the Universe, the judge of truth\u201d (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201c\u2026dayan ha-emet\u201d</span></b>) and one may <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tear their clothes</span></b>. (The latter tradition is sometimes echoed with mourners wearing a ribbon at a funeral, which they ritually tear.) After burial, <i class=\"ygk-term\">shiva</i> begins\u2014a seven-day period of mourning (colloquially in English, \u201csitting shiva\u201d) during which the family of the deceased person receives visitors at home, shares recollections of the deceased, prays communally, and eats traditional comfort foods (e.g., eggs, whose round shape recalls the cycle of life). Mourners minimize vanity (keeping personal grooming to a minimum, covering mirrors, not wearing fancy clothes such as those involving leather) and avoid joyous events. A period of less intense mourning, <i class=\"ygk-term\">shloshim</i> (literally, \u201cthirty\u201d) lasts 30 days after burial, during which mourners continue avoiding joyous events, and specifically in the case of people mourning a parent, a less intense period of mourning lasts a year following the death. Mourners recite <i class=\"ygk-term\">kaddish yatom</i> (colloquially just <i>kaddish</i>), a prayer praising God but containing no direct reference to death, throughout the mourning period. On each (Hebrew-calendar) anniversary of a death, family members light a <i class=\"ygk-term\">yahrzeit candle</i>, which burns for 24 hours in memory of the deceased.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Conversion.</span></b> A non-Jewish person who wishes to become Jewish may do so with the guidance and approval of a <i class=\"ygk-term\">beit din</i>, a Jewish court. Judaism does not seek converts; in fact, it is traditional for a rabbi to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">refuse a prospective convert three times</span></b>, and only if they still persist should the rabbi take them as a student. A <i class=\"ygk-term\">ger</i> (convert) must study Judaism and explain their motivation to the satisfaction of the <i>beit din</i>, and must immerse in a <i class=\"ygk-term\">mikveh</i> (ritual bath). Men must also be <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">circumcised</span></b>, or if they were already circumcised, a drop of blood must be taken from the penis as a symbolic circumcision (<i class=\"ygk-term\">hatafah dam brit</i>). Different Jewish movements have different views on conversion, and some movements will not recognize conversions performed by rabbis from other movements. Conversion may be sought by gentiles wishing to marry a Jewish person, children raised as Jews but who are not technically Jewish (e.g., because their father is Jewish but their mother is not), or simply people who find Judaism attractive for other reasons.</li>"

                "<li>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Inductor</span></b> A <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">solenoid</span></b> is a coil of wire. When electric current through the wire changes, a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">magnetic field</span></b> is generated in the core (interior) of the solenoid. When a solenoid is used in a circuit, it is called an inductor and serves to oppose changes in the current in the circuit. The strength of an inductor is its <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">inductance</span></b>, symbolized <i>L</i> and measured in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">henries</span></b> (after Joseph Henry, who discovered the principles of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">self-inductance</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mutual inductance</span></b>, though <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Michael Faraday</span></b> published his findings on electromagnetic induction first).</p>\n<p>The voltage across an inductor only depends on the change in current, so inductors are particularly used with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">alternating current</span></b>. For standard (sinusoidal) alternating current, an inductor only changes the <em class=\"ygk-term\">phase</em> of the current through it.</p>\n<p>Inductors function the same way as resistors when arranged in series or parallel.</p>\n</li>",
                "<li>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Transformer</span></b> A transformer is a pair of solenoids connected to a central <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">core</span></b>, which permits the circulation of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">magnetic flux</span></b>. Because the flux in the core is constant, an alternating current in one coil produces a changing magnetic field, inducing an alternating current in the second coil. If the coils have different numbers of turns of wire (as is typical), the current in the second coil will have a different voltage than the current in the first coil. Therefore, transformers are used to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cstep up\u201d</span></b> or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cstep down\u201d</span></b> voltage, for example in power transmission lines and in adapters for household electronics.</p>\n</li>",

A circuit\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">reactance</span></b> is the imaginary part of its impedance and depends on the frequency of the circuit. When reactance is balanced, we find the frequency at which the circuit loses the least energy, or its <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">resonant frequency</span></b>.</p>\n</li>",
                "<li>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Ground</span></b> A ground or earth is a point on a circuit that is connected to the ground. This is to prevent accidental discharge of electricity from an unexpected connection\u2014a person who touches an ungrounded circuit might cause electricity to pass through their body. This lets ground act as a known reference point of voltage for analyzing circuits: any grounded point in the circuit is typically understood to have zero voltage.</p>\n</li>",
                "<li>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Fuses and circuit breakers</span></b> When excess current flows through a fuse, the fuse deforms or disconnects so that no current can flow in the circuit. This protects the equipment in the circuit from being damaged by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">power surges</span></b> and also protects the surroundings (as excess current can cause wires to overheat, starting a fire). Fuses typically melt and thus must be completely replaced after tripping; a circuit breaker is a form of fuse that can be reset and restored after the circuit has been verified to be safe.</p>\n</li>",

In practice, there is a minimum voltage that must be provided before current will flow, called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bias voltage</span></b>, and there is a voltage past which the resistance of the diode reduces and current flows backward, called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">breakdown voltage</span></b>.</p>\n<p>In a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zener diode</span></b>, the breakdown voltage is well-defined with as sharp a transition as possible, so engineers can design a circuit around the breakdown voltage characteristic.</p>\n</li>",

There are various ways to wire an op-amp, often feeding an output back into an input, to accomplish interesting tasks like subtracting and multiplying voltages.</p>\n<p>An ideal op-amp is assumed to have infinite gain, so when solving a circuit, the two inputs must reach a point with no voltage difference across them. Real op-amps have finite gain, impedance across their inputs, resistance on their output, and a finite bandwidth or spread of operating frequencies when used with alternating current.</p>\n</li>"

The three neutrinos are neutral and nearly massless (they were once thought to be entirely massless), while the other three have a charge of \u20131.  All neutrinos are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fermions</span></b>, and the total number of leptons is always <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">conserved</span></b> (counting regular leptons as +1 particle and anti-leptons as \u20131 particle).  The word \u201clepton\u201d comes from the Greek for \u201clight\u201d (the opposite of \u201cheavy,\u201d not illumination), even though the muon and tauon are relatively massive.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Quarks</span></b> are another class of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fundamental particle</span></b>.

The up, charm, and top quarks have a charge of +2/3, while the down, strange, and bottom have a charge of \u20131/3.  All quarks are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fermions</span></b>, and they combine in pairs to form <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mesons</span></b> and in triples to form <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">baryons</span></b>.  The enormous mass of the top quark (178\u00a0GeV) made it difficult to create in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">particle accelerators</span></b>, but its discovery in 1995 confirmed an essential element of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Standard Model</span></b> of particle physics.  The name \u201cquark\u201d comes from the line <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cThree quarks for Muster Mark\u201d</span></b> in <i class=\"ygk-term\">Finnegans Wake</i> that appealed to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Murray Gell-Mann</span></b>.  The study of quarks (and of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">strong nuclear force</span></b>) is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quantum chromodynamics</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Baryons</span></b> are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">composite</span></b> (i.e., non-fundamental) <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">particles</span></b> made from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">three quarks</span></b>.  The most common examples are the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">proton</span></b> (two up quarks and one down quark) and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">neutron</span></b> (two down quarks and one up).  All baryons are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fermions</span></b>.  Quarks possess a characteristic called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201ccolor\u201d</span></b> (which has nothing to do with visual color) which can be either red, green, or blue (arbitrary names; again, no relation to the colors we see).  A baryon must have <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">one quark of each color</span></b> so that the \u201ctotal color\u201d (analogous to mixing red, green, and blue light) is colorless (i.e., \u201cwhite\u201d).

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Mesons</span></b> are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">composite particles</span></b> generally made from a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quark and an anti-quark</span></b>.  There are dozens of examples including the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pion</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">kaon</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">J/Psi</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rho</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">D</span></b>.  All mesons are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bosons</span></b>.  The quark and anti-quark must have the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">same color</span></b> (such as red and anti-red) so that the resulting meson is colorless (or \u201cwhite\u201d).

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Fermions</span></b> are particles with half-integral <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">spin</span></b>.  Spin is a form of \u201cintrinsic angular momentum,\u201d possessed by particles as if they were spinning around their axis (but they aren\u2019t).  The values cited for spin are not (usually) the real magnitude of that angular momentum, but the component of the angular momentum along one axis.  Quantum mechanics restricts that component to being <i>n</i>/2 times <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Planck\u2019s constant</span></b> divided by 2\u03c0 for some integer <i>n</i>.  If <i>n</i> is even, this results in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cintegral\u201d spin</span></b>, if it is odd, it results in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201chalf-integral\u201d spin</span></b>.  Note that the exact value of the spin itself is a real number; it\u2019s the multiplier of <i>h</i>/2\u03c0 that determines whether it is \u201cintegral\u201d or not.  The most significant thing about fermions is that they are subject to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pauli Exclusion Principle</span></b>:  No two fermions can have the same <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quantum numbers</span></b> (i.e., same state).  The name \u201cfermion\u201d comes from the name of the Italian-American physicist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Enrico Fermi</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Bosons</span></b> are particles with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">integral spin</span></b>.  All particles are either bosons or fermions.  The spin of a composite particle is determined by the total spin (i.e., the component of its intrinsic angular momentum along one axis) of its particles.  For instance, an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">alpha particle</span></b> (two <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">protons</span></b> and two <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">neutrons</span></b>) has four half-integral spin values.  No matter how they are added up, the result will be an integral spin value (try it!), so an alpha particle is a (composite) boson.  The Pauli Exclusion Principle does <em>not</em> apply to bosons (in fact, bosons prefer to be in the same quantum state).  The name \u201cboson\u201d comes from the name of the Indian physicist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Satyendra Nath Bose</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Hadrons</span></b> are any particles made out of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quarks</span></b> (alternatively, any particle affected by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">strong nuclear force</span></b>).  Generally, this means the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">baryons</span></b> and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mesons</span></b>.

That is, forces result from particles emitting and absorbing gauge bosons.  The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">strong nuclear force</span></b> is carried by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gluons</span></b>, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">weak nuclear force</span></b> is carried by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">W</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Z<sup>\u2013</sup></span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Z<sup>+</sup> particles</span></b>, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">electromagnetic force</span></b> is carried by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">photon</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gravity</span></b> is carried by the (as yet unobserved) <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">graviton</span></b>.

                "<li>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Polynomials</span></b> are functions made of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">terms</span></b> added together, in which each term is a number times a product of variables raised to nonnegative-integer powers.  For instance, 3<i>x</i><sup>2</sup><i>y</i> and \u2013\u03c0<i>x</i><sup>7</sup><i>y</i><sup>2</sup><i>z</i><sup>3</sup> are each terms, so 3<i>x</i><sup>2</sup><i>y</i>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u03c0<i>x</i><sup>7</sup><i>y</i><sup>2</sup><i>z</i><sup>3</sup> is a polynomial.  (Individual terms are also considered polynomials.)  Much of math is concerned with polynomials involving only one variable, such as \u2013<i>x</i><sup>3</sup>\u00a0+\u00a02<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>.  The number at the beginning of each term is called a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">coefficient</span></b>.</p>\n<p>Since simple numbers (\u201cconstants\u201d) can also be written as the same number times any variable to the zeroth power (that is, 6 is the same as 6<i>x</i><sup>0</sup>), numbers are also considered terms and polynomials.  So <i>x</i>\u00a0+\u00a06 is a polynomial, as is just \u20134.</p>\n<p>Polynomials can be classified according to their number of terms: a polynomial with one term, like 2<i>x</i> or \u201312<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, is called a <b><span class=\"label\">monomial</span></b>; a polynomial with two terms is called a <b><span class=\"label\">binomial</span></b>; and a polynomial with three terms is called a <b><span class=\"label\">trinomial</span></b>.</p>\n<p>Each polynomial has a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">degree</span></b>.  For polynomials of one variable, the degree is the largest exponent on the variable, so for the polynomial 4<i>x</i><sup>3</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, the degree is 3.  For polynomials of multiple variables, to find the degree you calculate the sum of the variables\u2019 exponents on each term, then choose the largest such sum, so the degree of 3<i>x</i><sup>6</sup><i>y</i><sup>5</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<i>x</i><sup>2</sup><i>y</i><sup>3</sup> is calculated by adding 6+5\u00a0=\u00a011 for the first term and 2+3\u00a0=\u00a05 for the second and noting that 11 is larger, so the degree is 11.  A polynomial that is just a constant has degree 0.  A polynomial with degree 1, like 3<i>x</i>, is called <b><span class=\"label\">linear</span></b>; a polynomial with degree 2, like 3<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a08x\u00a0+\u00a04, is called <b><span class=\"label\">quadratic</span></b>; a polynomial with degree 3 is called <b><span class=\"label\">cubic</span></b>; continuing with increasing degrees, the terms are <b><span class=\"label\">quartic</span></b>, <b><span class=\"label\">quintic</span></b>, <b><span class=\"label\">sextic</span></b>, and so on, though terms corresponding to degrees larger than 5 are seldom used.  For technical reasons that are beyond the scope of this article, the zero polynomial (i.e., <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a00) is said to have a degree of \u2013\u221e or an undefined degree.</p>\n<p>The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fundamental theorem of algebra</span></b> is the statement that every single-variable polynomial, other than constants, has a root in the complex numbers, which means that if <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) is a polynomial, then the equation <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a00 has at least one solution where <i>x</i> is some complex number.</p>\n<p>There are formulas to find those roots for linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic polynomials, though the latter two formulas are extremely complicated.  The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Abel-Ruffini theorem</span></b>, also called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Abel\u2019s impossibility theorem</span></b>, is the statement that there is no way to find a formula for the solutions of all quintic or higher-degree polynomials, if the formula must be based on the traditional operations (addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, and exponentiation/taking roots).  That impossibility is the topic that began an area of study called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Galois <b><span class=\"pg\">gal-wah</span></b> theory</span></b>, which is part of abstract algebra.</p>\n</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Quadratics</span></b> are, as mentioned above, polynomials of degree 2.  The graph of a quadratic equation will be in the shape of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">parabola</span></b> that opens straight up (if the coefficient on the <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> term is positive) or straight down (if that coefficient is negative).  It is possible to find the roots of a quadratic by graphing it, factoring it, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">completing the square</span></b> on it, or using the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quadratic formula</span></b> (itself derived by completing the square) on it.  If the quadratic is in the form <i>a</i><i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0+\u00a0<i>b</i><i>x</i>\u00a0+\u00a0<i>c</i>, then the expression <i>b</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a04<i>a</i><i>c</i>, which appears in the quadratic formula, is called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">discriminant</span></b>.  If the discriminant is positive, the quadratic will have two real roots; if the discriminant is zero, the quadratic will have one real root (said to have a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">multiplicity</span></b> of 2); and if the discriminant is negative, the quadratic will have two non-real complex roots (and if the coefficients of the quadratic are real numbers, the complex roots will be <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">conjugates</span></b> of each other).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Rational functions</span></b> consist of one polynomial divided by another polynomial.  The denominator polynomial cannot be the zero polynomial, because dividing by zero is undefined. Examples therefore include 1/<i>x</i>, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>/(<i>x</i>\u00a0\u2013\u00a03), and (<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0+\u00a01)/(<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a01).  Every polynomial can be considered to be a rational function because 1 is a polynomial and dividing by 1 doesn\u2019t change an expression (so to consider the polynomial <i>x</i><sup>3</sup> as a rational function, think of it as <i>x</i><sup>3</sup>/1).  It is often instructive to study the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">asymptotes</span></b> of rational functions, which are places in which their graphs approach a line (or occasionally other shape), usually getting infinitely close to but not crossing it.  That analysis may require performing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">long division</span></b> on the numerator and denominator polynomials to find their <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">greatest common factor</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Periodic functions</span></b> are those whose graph repeats a pattern (specifically, the graph has <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">translational symmetry</span></b>).  Technically speaking, a function of one variable <i>f</i> is periodic if <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>+<i>p</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) for every <i>x</i> in the domain of the function and some positive number <i>p</i>, which is called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">period</span></b>, because the graph repeats itself every <i>p</i>\u00a0units.  While the trigonometric functions are the periodic functions most commonly encountered by high school math students, some other functions like triangle waves are also periodic; in general, functions representing waves tend to be periodic.

                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">trigonometric functions</span></b> represent relations between angles and sides of triangles.  They are often illustrated using points and segments related to a circle of radius\u00a01 centered at the origin, called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unit circle</span></b>.  By far the most commonly discussed trigonometric functions are the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sine</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cosine</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tangent</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cosecant</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">secant</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cotangent</span></b> functions.  There are <i>many</i> interesting relationships between these: the graphs of sine and cosine are translations of each other; the tangent function equals the sine function divided by the cosine function; the cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions are the reciprocals of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions, respectively; and there are many other relationships called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">trigonometric identities</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">inverse trigonometric functions</span></b> are, as one might expect, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">inverse functions</span></b> of the trigonometric functions.  (Note that \u201cinverse\u201d in this case refers to a function that \u201cundoes\u201d another, not to \u201cmultiplicative inverse,\u201d also called \u201creciprocal.\u201d)  They are sometimes just called \u201cinverse sine,\u201d etc, and are also given with the prefix \u201carc\u201d: <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arcsine</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arccosine</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arctangent</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arccosecant</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arcsecant</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arccotangent</span></b>.  They are sometimes notated in the form sin<sup>\u20131</sup> for arcsine, but that notation can be confusing, so NAQT tends to prefer \u201carcsine,\u201d etc.  Because the trigonometric functions are not bijective (see below), to have inverses it is necessary to restrict the domains of the inverse trigonometric functions; for instance, arcsin(<i>x</i>) is only defined for <i>x</i> between \u20131 and 1, inclusive.</li>",
                "<li>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Injective functions</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"label\">injections</span></b>, are functions that do not repeat any outputs.  For instance, <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a02<i>x</i> is injective, because for every possible output value, there is only one input that will result in that output.  On the other hand, <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0sin(<i>x</i>) is <em>not</em> injective, because (for instance) the output 0 can be obtained from several different inputs (0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, and so on).  If you have the graph of a function, you can determine whether the function is injective by applying the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">horizontal line test</span></b>:  if no horizontal line would ever intersect the graph twice, the function is injective.</p>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Surjective functions</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"label\">surjections</span></b>, are functions that achieve every possible output.  For instance, if you are thinking of functions whose domain and codomain are both the set of all real numbers, then <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0tan(<i>x</i>) is surjective, because every real number is an output for some input.  But <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> is not surjective, because (for instance) \u20133 is not an output for any real-number input.  The term <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">image</span></b> is sometimes used for the set of all output values that a function actually achieves; a surjective function, then, is one whose image equals its codomain.</p>\n<p>A function that is both injective and surjective is called <b><span class=\"label\">bijective</span></b>, or a <b><span class=\"label\">bijection</span></b>.

They are the inverses of the exponential functions with the same bases.  Logarithmic functions are used to model <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sensory perception</span></b> and some phenomena in probability and statistics.  The phrase \u201c<em>the</em> logarithm\u201d can refer to a logarithmic function using the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">base\u00a02</span></b> (especially in computer science; this is also called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">binary logarithm</span></b>), <i>e</i> (especially in higher math), or 10 (especially in lower levels of math and physical sciences). The phrase <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">natural logarithm</span></b> refers to the logarithm base\u00a0<i>e</i>, and the phrase <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">common logarithm</span></b> usually refers to the logarithm base\u00a010.</li>",

Continuity is often explained as a function\u2019s graph being drawable in one motion without lifting the writing utensil from the paper.  All polynomials are continuous, as are the sine and cosine functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">absolute value function</span></b>.  Some examples of non-continuous functions are many rational functions, as they often have holes or asymptotes; the tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions, which have asymptotes; and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">floor and ceiling functions</span></b>, which have jumps.</li>",

Like continuity, differentiability is really a property of a specific point, and a differentiable function is one that is differentiable at every point.  Every differentiable function is continuous, but some continuous functions are not differentiable; mathematicians thus say that differentiability is a stronger property than continuity.  In terms of graphs, a differentiable function has a \u201csmooth\u201d graph with no <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">corners</span></b> or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cusps</span></b> (and also, because continuity is required, no holes, jumps, or asymptotes).  All polynomials are differentiable, as are the sine and cosine functions, and exponential and logarithmic functions.  However, the absolute value function <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0|<i>x</i>| is not differentiable because it has a \u201ccorner\u201d at <i>x</i>\u00a0=\u00a00 (but recall that it is still continuous).</li>"

Both of these groups, like all other plants, reproduce by producing sperm and eggs on a structure called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gametophyte</span></b>. The gametes fuse to form another structure called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sporophyte</span></b>, which produces spores that disperse and grow into new gametophytes.

The discovery of Ceres involved the collaboration of multiple scientists, including <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Carl Friedrich Gauss</span></b>, whose calculations of Ceres\u2019s orbital path allowed it to be found again after it was lost due to the Sun. In 2006, with the demotion of Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet, Ceres was also reclassified as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dwarf planet</span></b>, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. In 2015, NASA\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Dawn</i> probe reached Ceres, beginning an extended observation.

Eris is a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">scattered disc object</span></b>, meaning it was \u201cscattered\u201d out of the Kuiper belt by the gravity of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Neptune</span></b>, falling into a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">high-eccentricity orbit</span></b> that ranges between 38 and 97\u00a0AU from the Sun. Upon its discovery, Eris was thought to be both larger and more massive than Pluto; later observations concluded Pluto did have a greater surface area, but was less massive. Eris\u2019s discovery and its potential classification as another planet prompted the 2006 IAU redefinition of the term \u201cplanet\u201d that excluded Pluto (and Eris).

The Carboniferous is named for the abundant coal deposits dated to that time. Receding seas led to the prevalence of lowland <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">swamps</span></b>, which were filled with lignin-rich trees and numerous ferns. These extensive forests sequestered carbon dioxide, leading to an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">increase in atmospheric oxygen levels</span></b> to about 35%, as compared to 21% today. High oxygen levels may have led to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gigantism</span></b> in insects; millipedes grew to over 8\u00a0feet long and dragonflies had wingspans of 30\u00a0inches. The Carboniferous is also known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Age of Amphibians</span></b>, as tetrapods became the dominant terrestrial animals and began to diversify.

Another definition of conic sections is that, for any point <i>P</i> on the curve, the distance from <i>P</i> to a point called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">focus</span></b> is equal to a constant multiple of the distance from <i>P</i> to a line called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">directrix</span></b>; the constant multiple is the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">eccentricity</span></b>, a dimensionless number that describes how \u201csquashed\u201d the curve is or how far away it is from being a circle.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">A limit</span></b> is a value that a function approaches as the input approaches another value, even if the function is not equal to that output value (or even defined there). For example, the limit of 1/<i>x</i> as <i>x</i> gets infinity large (\u201capproaches infinity\u201d) is 0, even though the function never actually reaches 0. The definition of a limit is formalized in a way traditionally written with the Greek letters <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">epsilon and delta</span></b>, a technique developed by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Augustin-Louis Cauchy</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Continuity</span></b> is informally defined as the ability of a function\u2019s graph to be <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">drawn without lifting the pen</span></b>. Properly, a function is continuous at a given point if the function has a limit at that point and is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">equal to its limit</span></b> there. It is also common to speak of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201ccontinuous functions,\u201d</span></b> which are functions that are continuous at every point. Polynomials are continuous, as are exponential and logarithmic functions, sine, and cosine. However, the other four trigonometric functions (cosecant, secant, tangent, and cotangent) are not continuous at some points (the ones at which their graphs have asymptotes), and rational functions generally have some points of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">discontinuity</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The derivative</span></b> is an operation that takes a function and results in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">another function</span></b> that gives the original function\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">rate of change</span></b>. Taking a derivative is called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">differentiation</span></b> and is carried out with respect to the input variable that is changing. The derivative is calculated as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">limit of a tangent line</span></b> between two points on the function\u2019s graph as the two points get arbitrarily close together. At any given point, the derivative\u2019s value is equal to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">slope of the tangent line</span></b> to the function\u2019s graph at that point. The derivative of a function <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) is notated as <i>f</i>\u2032(<i>x</i>) (Lagrange\u2019s notation, pronounced \u201c<i>f</i> prime of <i>x</i>\u201d) or d<i>f</i>/d<i>x</i> (Leibniz notation, pronounced \u201cd <i>f</i> d <i>x</i>). Differentiation can be repeated, e.g,. differentiating a function twice gives its second derivative (<i>f</i>\u2032\u2032(<i>x</i>) or d\u00b2<i>f</i>/d<i>x</i>\u00b2).</li>",
                "<li>A function is called <b><span class=\"label\">differentiable</span></b> if its derivative can be evaluated. Like for continuity, this can be stated about a specific point or the whole function. The absolute value function is an example of a function that is differentiable in some places but not others: it is differentiable everywhere except at an input of 0, where its graph has a sharp <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">corner</span></b>. Differentiability is a stronger property than continuity: a function can only be differentiable if it is continuous, but it could be only continuous and not differentiable (the absolute value function being an example of that).

An integral is denoted by a \u201clong S\u201d symbol, \u222b. Definite integration is performed between two endpoints (e.g., the integral between 0 and 5), and those endpoints are written above and below, or next to, the integral symbol.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Riemann sums</span></b> are a way to formalize the definition of an integral.

The second part states that the definite integral of <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> can be calculated as <i>F</i>(<i>b</i>)\u00a0\u2212\u00a0<i>F</i>(<i>a</i>), where <i>F</i> is an antiderivative of <i>f</i>.</li>",

                "<li>\n<p>An <b><span class=\"label\">algorithm</span></b> is a set of detailed instructions for solving a problem, such as \u201csort a list\u201d or \u201cdivide two numbers.\u201d Algorithms can be described in human language, a programming language, or in other ways, but they are written in detail to explain how to handle all possible inputs (e.g., the list to sort or the numbers to divide) or fail if the task is impossible (e.g., if dividing two numbers and the second is 0).</p>\n<p>The word \u201calgorithm\u201d derives from the name of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Al-Khwarizmi</span></b>, a Persian scholar also credited with some of the most fundamental principles in algebra.</p>\n<p>Computer scientists analyze how many steps algorithms need (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">time complexity</span></b>) and how much memory they need for temporary storage of intermediate results (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">space complexity</span></b>). The worst-case situations are expressed using <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">big\u00a0O notation</span></b>; for example, if an algorithm to sort a list of <i>n</i>\u00a0items might need up to <i>n</i><sup>2</sup> to sort the list, the algorithm\u2019s worst-case time complexity is <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>). (This is a simplification of the mathematics of asymptotic notation.)</p>\n</li>",
                "<li>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Recursion</span></b> is a technique used in some algorithms. Sometimes an algorithm calls itself to solve a smaller case of the problem, until it reaches a simple <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">base case</span></b> that is already solved. For example, a recursive algorithm to calculate <i>n</i>\u00a0factorial uses the fact that <i>n</i>!\u00a0=\u00a0<i>n</i>\u00b7(<i>n</i>\u22121)!, so it calls itself on <i>n</i>\u22121 and keeps going with smaller values until it reaches the base case of 1!, which is just 1.</p>\n<p><b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tail recursion</span></b> is the use of recursion as the last step of an algorithm. Algorithms that use tail recursion are often more optimized by compilers. Recursive algorithms can have their big\u00a0O runtime calculated by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Master theorem</span></b>.</p>\n</li>",
                "<li>\n<p>A <b><span class=\"label\">graph</span></b> is a mathematical concept often used in algorithms, in which a set of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">vertices</span></b> is connected by a set of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">edges</span></b>. In visual representations, the vertices are shown as dots, with edges shown as lines between the two vertices they connect. A <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">path</span></b> between two vertices is a sequence of edges that starts at the first vertex and ends at the last. A <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cycle</span></b> is a path that begins and ends at the same vertex.</p>\n<p>A graph is called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">weighted</span></b> if every edge has a number representing the \u201ccost\u201d of traveling the edge; weighted graphs are used, for example, in analyzing navigation, with vertices representing cities, edges representing roads between them, and weights representing distance (or travel time). A graph is called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">directed</span></b> if each edge has an inherent direction (an edge going from vertex\u00a0<i>A</i> to vertex\u00a0<i>B</i>, but not from <i>B</i> to <i>A</i>), e.g., representing a one-way road</p>\n<p>Graphs are also called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">networks</span></b>, and this is the origin of the term <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">social network</span></b>: if vertices represent people and edges represent who knows whom, a social network is a graph of a collection of people and the relationships between them.</p>\n<p>Graphs are used to organize data (often in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">trees</span></b>, which are graphs in which you can reach any vertex from any other vertex, but there are no cycles), analyze navigation/travel (broadly construed, such as the flow of fluid in a complex pipe system), manage tasks and scheduling (with edges representing dependencies), and more.</p>\n<p><b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm</span></b> is used to find the shortest path between two vertices of a graph (possibly a weighted graph, in which case \u201cshortest\u201d means least total weight). <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Prim\u2019s algorithm</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kruskal\u2019s algorithm</span></b> are used to find a graph\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">minimum spanning tree</span></b>, that is a tree connecting all its vertices whose edges have the smallest possible total weight.</p>\n</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Divide-and-conquer algorithms</span></b> use recursion to split problems into smaller subproblems with smaller input sets. By solving the same problem on each of these subproblems, then combining the outputs in some way, a divide-and-conquer algorithm can efficiently solve problems on big input sets. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Merge sort</span></b> (a sorting algorithm), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">binary search</span></b> (an algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list), and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Karatsuba\u2019s algorithm</span></b> (an algorithm for multiplying integers) are examples of divide-and-conquer algorithms.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Greedy algorithms</span></b> are algorithms that make the locally optimum or \u201cbest\u201d choice at every step. Such algorithms may or may not produce an overall best solution. Consider an algorithm for making change in which you pick the largest coin smaller than or equal to the amount of change you need to give. If you need to give 7\u00a2 change, you first pick a nickel (5\u00a2) and still have to make 2\u00a2 change, so you pick a penny (1\u00a2) and still have to make 1\u00a2, so you add an additional penny and have broken the 7\u00a2 into 5\u00a2\u00a0+\u00a01\u00a2\u00a0+\u00a01\u00a2. In the U.S. coin system, this is optimal in the sense of using as few coins as possible, namely three coins. However, in a coin system that offered coins worth 1\u00a2, 3\u00a2, 4\u00a2, and 5\u00a2, the greedy algorithm would give the same solution, even though a solution with fewer coins is possible (4\u00a2\u00a0+\u00a03\u00a2).</li>",
                "<li>A <b><span class=\"label\">programming language</span></b> is a way to write algorithms and other instructions in a way that can (usually after additional steps) be understood and executed by a computer. Almost all programming languages have ways of defining <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">variables</span></b>, which hold data, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">functions</span></b>, which are sets of instructions that achieve some task (such as performing an algorithm). <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Java</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">JavaScript</span></b> (which is not the same as Java), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">C</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">C++</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Python</span></b> are common programming languages. Programming languages can be categorized by their <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">paradigm</span></b> (which is a general sense of how the code tends to be structured), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">typing</span></b> (see below), how they are run (compiled or interpreted), and in other ways.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Object-oriented programming</span></b> is a programming paradigm that involves the creation of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">objects</span></b> from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">classes</span></b> that can hold data and transform it in various ways. A class is a definition of the fundamental properties than an object has, while objects are specific examples of a class (for instance, the general idea of a dog is a class, while your pet dog would be an object.) <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Inheritance</span></b> allows subclasses to be defined so that the properties of a parent class are present in the sub-class (for example, \u201cschnauzer\u201d might be a subclass of \u201cdog\u201d). In <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">composition</span></b>, an object contains or references another object (which might or might not be of the same class, e.g., a dog\u2019s digestive system might be another object). Object-oriented programming also often uses <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">encapsulation</span></b> to hide unnecessary details from other aspects, e.g., a dog\u2019s digestive system doesn\u2019t need to know about its circulatory system. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Polymorphism</span></b> is the idea that different classes may be able to do the same things in potentially different ways, e.g., animals all eat but they do so in different ways. Java and C++ are object-oriented languages.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Functional programming</span></b> is a paradigm based on the execution of various functions to calculate values. Functions in pure functional programming are free of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">side effects</span></b>, meaning that they do not change the program state but only compute values. Functional languages use <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">currying</span></b> to evaluate functions with multiple inputs. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ML</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Haskell</span></b> are functional programming languages.</li>",
                "<li>A <b><span class=\"label\">compiler</span></b> is used with many programming languages to convert human-readable code into instructions that a machine can execute. C and C++ programs are often compiled by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">GCC</span></b> into code specific for the machine the compiler is running on. Java\u2019s compiler instead compiles into a less specific format called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bytecode</span></b>, which is executed by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Java Virtual Machine</span></b> (JVM). Since compiled Java can be run on any machine with a JVM, Java is referred to as \u201cwrite once, run anywhere.\u201d Some languages are not compiled before running but instead have their code turned into machine instructions as they run, such as JavaScript and Python; these languages are called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">interpreted</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li>\n<p>A language\u2019s <b><span class=\"label\">typing</span></b> refers to how the type of data a variable holds is defined and can or can\u2019t change. Common types of variables are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">booleans</span></b>, which can only be true or false; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">strings</span></b>, which hold text; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">integers</span></b>; and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">floats</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">doubles</span></b>, which hold non-integer numbers.</p>\n<p>In <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">statically typed languages</span></b>, a variable is given a type the first time it is used and can\u2019t be changed; compilers check that all variables have the correct types while the program is compiling, which helps catch errors but also makes some tasks more difficult. Java, C, and C++ have static typing.</p>\n<p><b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dynamically typed languages</span></b> do not check types when compiling, which makes some tasks easier, but type errors (e.g., trying to multiply two strings) can occur while the program is running. Python and JavaScript are dynamically typed.</p>\n<p>Some languages support <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">duck typing</span></b>, which is sort of intermediate between static and dynamic typing. Duck typing essentially allows objects to do the same or similar things even if their classes have no formal relation. For example, airplanes and birds might both have a \u201cfly\u201d capability even though neither is a subclass of the other (or otherwise related).</p>\n</li>",

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Apollo\u00a013</span></b> was supposed to land in the Fra Mauro region of the Moon.

The explosion also damaged the No.\u00a01 oxygen tank and caused further leakage. To bring back the astronauts, the orbiter was put on a free-return trajectory around the Moon. NASA engineers also solved power-management, water-conservation, and trajectory planning problems with the help of Ken Mattingly, the primary Command Module pilot who had been grounded due to exposure to German measles. All three astronauts returned to Earth safely, and the landing site was re-assigned to the subsequent Apollo\u00a014 mission.</li>",

The fire was exacerbated by the <a href=\"http://www.space.com/14379-apollo1-fire-space-capsule-safety-improvements.html\">pure-oxygen</a>, positive-pressure environment inside the capsule, and the fact that the capsule door opened inward. Both of these design elements were scrapped in subsequent missions, and the second was replaced with an outward-opening hatch nominally to facilitate spacewalks. Lessons learned from Apollo\u00a01 were also taken into account during the design of the Space Shuttle.</li>",

The Challenger disaster was attributed by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rogers Commission</span></b> (the investigative body set up after the accident) to poor performance of the solid rocket booster (SRB) O-rings. The O-rings lost integrity and became brittle at low temperatures, such as those present on the morning of the launch. The failure of the O-rings caused \u201cblow-by,\u201d where hot gasses escaped the booster joint, ultimately resulting in the destruction of Challenger. The Rogers Commission also cited both NASA and SRB contractor Morton Thiokol for a failure to redesign the SRB joint, known to be dangerous\u2014manifestations of \u201cgo fever.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, the disaster on STS-107 was due to a piece of foam from the external fuel tank hitting and breaching the left wing of the Orbiter during launch. The breach damaged the heat shielding, allowing hot gas to enter the Orbiter during re-entry. Ultimately, that damage caused the vehicle to disintegrate over Texas.</p>\n<p>Both missions resulted in the complete loss of crew (seven crew were on each mission) and orbiters. Both modes of failure had been previously observed in earlier missions, but went un-fixed because those missions were successful.</p>\n</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Apollo-Soyuz Test Project</span></b> marked a definite end to the Space Race, and was a symbol of the de-escalation of tensions between the US and the USSR. Deke Slayton, an original Mercury\u00a07 astronaut grounded for medical reasons until 1973, was accompanied by Tom Stafford and Vance Brand on the last launch of Apollo before the advent of the Space Shuttle. The mission demonstrated that two dissimilar spacecraft could rendezvous and dock while in space (an Apollo Command Module and Soyuz\u00a019 docked), and also enabled the crew of Soyuz to <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo-soyuz/astp_mission.html\">photograph the Sun\u2019s corona</a> through an artificial eclipse created by the Apollo spacecraft.

That correction resulted in a proper orbital insertion for the primary payload (a Dragon resupply vehicle), but an unstable, decaying orbit for its secondary payload (an ORBCOMM satellite). This was taken as a proof of concept by SpaceX for the redundant, multiple-engine design.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Supply</span></b> and <b><span class=\"label\">Demand</span></b>.  Supply and demand embody the general idea that, at any given price, producers are willing to produce a given amount of a good (the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quantity supplied</span></b>) and consumers are willing to buy a different amount (the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quantity demanded</span></b>).  As the price rises, firms will be willing to supply more goods, but fewer will be demanded; conversely, as price falls, consumers will demand more goods, but fewer will be supplied.  On a graph showing price and quantity on its two axes, this is represented by a downward-sloping <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">demand curve</span></b> and an upward-sloping <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">supply curve</span></b>.  Where the two curves intersect, there is an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">equilibrium</span></b>; economists predict this equilibrium quantity will be produced (and consumed) in a free market.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Elasticity</span></b>.  Elasticity is a measure of how much one economic variable changes in response to a change in a different variable, expressed in the form of \u201cEvery 1% change in the independent (second) variable leads to an <i>x</i>% change in the value of the first (dependent) variable.\u201d  A common example is the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">price elasticity of demand</span></b>, which measures the degree to which the quantity demanded changes when the price is altered.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Monopoly</span></b>.  A monopoly occurs when there is only one firm producing goods for a given market.  This allows that firm to set the price higher\u2014and thus the quantity sold lower\u2014than would otherwise occur.  An <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">oligopoly</span></b> is a similar market environment where production is dominated by a few firms, whereas a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">monopsony</span></b> is the opposite case:  a market with only a single consumer.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Tariff</span></b>.  A tariff is a tax placed on the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">import</span></b> (common) or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">export</span></b> (rarer) of a good.  Tariffs have various \u2014 often controversial \u2014 sociopolitical goals, but economists agree that they raise consumer prices relative to equilibrium (resulting in a lower quantity demanded).  Tariffs are similar to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quotas</span></b>, in which a government limits the amount of a good that may be imported.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Factors of production</span></b>.  There are three classical factors of production:  <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">land</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">labor</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">capital</span></b> (i.e., machinery and tools).  Modern economists sometimes add a fourth, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">entrepreneurship</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Unemployment</span></b>.  The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unemployment rate</span></b> refers to the percentage of the population that is actively seeking work but cannot find a job. Unemployment can be <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cyclical</span></b> (common in seasonal industries like fieldwork), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">frictional</span></b> (the natural time between jobs that exists in most labor markets), or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">structural</span></b> (when workers\u2019 skills do not match those required by open jobs).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Gross Domestic Product</span></b>.  Gross domestic product (or <b><span class=\"label\">GDP</span></b>), is a commonly used measure of the size of a country\u2019s or state\u2019s economy.  GDP is computed by summing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">consumption</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">investment</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">government expenditures</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">exports</span></b>, and then subtracting <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">imports</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Inflation.</span></b>  The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">inflation rate</span></b> is the pace at which prices are rising, usually expressed in the form \u201c2.5% per year.\u201d  This is equivalent to the rate at which currency loses its value.  Inflation is often measured by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">consumer price index</span></b>, which establishes a standard <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">basket of goods</span></b> that a family might buy and seeing how its total price changes over a year.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Interest rate</span></b>.  The interest rate is a \u201cprice of money,\u201d inasmuch as it is the amount one must pay to use somebody else\u2019s money (\u201cborrow\u201d) for a given period of time; the term is also used for the payment the lender (e.g., a person with a savings account) receives for loaning out his money.  Because <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">inflation</span></b> lowers the value of currency, economists routinely distinguish between <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">nominal interest rates</span></b> (the actual amount earned by a lender/saver) and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">real interest rates</span></b> (which are corrected for the inflation rate).  A savings account earning 5% interest is not acquiring the ability to buy more things if prices are also going up by 5% per year!</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Comparative advantage</span></b>.  Comparative advantage is the idea that every pair of potential trading partners (two firms, two neighbors, two countries, etc.) can benefit by trade if they are producing at least two goods.  The counterintuitive aspect is that this result is true for <em>every</em> pair, no matter how <em>un</em>productive one of the parties might be (in absolute terms).  Broadly speaking, each party should specialize in what it does best (relative to the other party) and then trade for everything else.  David Ricardo formulated this theory with a famous example involving Britain\u2019s cloth industry and Portugal\u2019s wine industry.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Invisible hand</span></b>.  The invisible hand is the metaphorical notion that producers and consumers acting in their own narrow interest (e.g., by trying to maximize income from their business) will create an overall benefit to society.  This might happen by their rewarding technologies that make production more efficient, rewarding firms who can sell at lower cost, rewarding inventors who discover new processes, and so on.  The phrase was introduced by Adam Smith in his 1776 book <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>, but the modern understanding (and broad-based application of the metaphor) is due to later thinkers.</li>"

Watson initially exposed an infant test subject (identified by the pseudonym \u201cAlbert\u201d) to numerous white, fluffy stimuli, such as a rat, a rabbit, and wool; the infant displayed no fear of these items. Watson then began to expose the infant to a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">white rat</span></b>, while banging a bar with a hammer to create a loud, scary noise whenever the infant interacted with the rat. Eventually, Albert began to react with distress when exposed to any white fluffy stimuli, including a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Santa Claus mask</span></b>.

They then asked the children to identify the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cnice doll,\u201d</span></b> the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cbad doll,\u201d</span></b> and other questions involving subjective judgments. The results of the study indicated that children of all races showed a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">preference for the white doll</span></b>, indicating that racism in American society created an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">inherent sense of inferiority</span></b> in Black children even by the age of five. The Clark\u2019s research was cited by the Supreme Court in its decision in <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> ordering the desegregation of schools.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">The first Asch conformity experiment</span></b> (1951) was designed and run by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Solomon Asch</span></b> at Swarthmore College in an attempt to see whether individuals would conform to the thinking of a group of peers in a situation in which the group was clearly wrong. Participants in the experiment were paired with seven other people\u2014all of whom were in on the plan. The groups were shown a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cbase\u201d line</span></b>, then were shown three other lines, and were asked to pick which of the three other lines was the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">same length</span></b> as the \u201cbase\u201d line. On pre-planned trials, the seven confederates each intentionally picked a line that was clearly a different length than the \u201cbase\u201d line. In nearly 40\u00a0percent of these trials, the subject of the experiment also gave an incorrect answer, likely to conform with the answer provided by the others. </li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Milgram obedience experiment</span></b> (1961) (often just called the \u201cMilgram experiment\u201d) was carried out at Yale University by psychologist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stanley Milgram</span></b>. Milgram was inspired to conduct the experiment by the high-profile trial of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Adolf Eichmann</span></b>, who claimed the Nazis carrying out the Holocaust did it because they were merely <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cfollowing orders.\u201d</span></b> In Milgram\u2019s experiment, the subject was led to believe they were administering <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">electric shocks</span></b> to a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201clearner\u201d</span></b> (who was assisting in running the experiment) to punish the learner for making mistakes. Subjects were ordered to increase the voltage to dangerously high levels as the experiment continued, as the learner <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">screamed in pain</span></b> and pleaded with them to stop; if they stopped to question whether the experiment was safe, they were told to continue. Over 60\u00a0percent of participants eventually administered shocks so powerful that they <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">would have killed the learner</span></b> had they been real.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Bobo doll experiment</span></b> (1961) was carried out by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Albert Bandura</span></b> at Stanford University, who wanted to study the effect of watching an adult model on the behavior of children. Children in the experiment observed an adult interacting with a \u201cBobo doll,\u201d a large self-righting toy designed to look like a clown. In some cases, the adult completely ignored the doll; in other cases, the adult was highly <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">aggressive</span></b> toward the doll, to the extent of throwing it, hitting it with a mallet, and yelling at it. Bandura found that children who observed an adult acting aggressively toward the doll were far more likely to act aggressively towards the doll themselves, as compared to children who watched a model ignoring the doll. The experiment provided support for the idea of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">social learning theory</span></b>, which holds that behaviors may be learned by observing models.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">The original Small-World experiment</span></b> (1966\u20131967) was carried out by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stanley Milgram</span></b> (who also carried out the obedience experiment) to examine the interconnectedness of Americans. Milgram mailed a number of people in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nebraska</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kansas</span></b> a package, and asked them to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">send it to a target in Boston</span></b>. If they knew the individual in Boston, they could send it directly to the target; if they did not, they were instructed to send it to a personal acquaintance who they believed would be most likely to know the person in Boston. This process continued until the package reached the final person in Boston. The experiment showed that, of the packages that did make their way to Boston, they typically did so in five or six steps, leading to the coining of the phrase <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201csix degrees of separation.\u201d</span></b> The experiment was an important early study of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">social networks</span></b>.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Martin Seligman\u2019s learned helplessness experiments</span></b> (1967) were instrumental in identifying that individuals who believe they are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">powerless</span></b> to stop a harmful stimulus will eventually stop trying to avoid it at all. Seligman divided a number of dogs into three groups: one group which received no electric shocks, one group that received electric shocks but could stop them by pressing a lever, and one group which was led to believe they had <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">no control</span></b> over when the shocks stopped or started. Each group of dogs was then placed into a new situation where they were given shocks but presented an easy means of escape. While the first two groups of dogs each quickly escaped from the shocks, the third group\u2014those given no control over the initial shocks\u2014made <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">no attempt at escape</span></b>. The experiment had major implications for the understanding and treatment of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">clinical depression</span></b> via therapy.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Stanford prison experiment</span></b> (1971) was designed by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Philip Zimbardo</span></b> to study the effects of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">power dynamics</span></b> in custodial situations. Participants\u2014college students at Stanford University\u2014were randomly assigned to be <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cguards\u201d</span></b> or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cprisoners\u201d</span></b> for a two-week period; the guards were instructed to refer to the prisoners only by their <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">number</span></b>, not their name. Although the experience was designed to be structured, by the second day prisoners had begun to rebel against the guards, and guards (including one nicknamed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cJohn Wayne\u201d</span></b>) began to implement sadistic practices designed to degrade, humiliate, and dehumanize inmates. The experiment was stopped after only six days when <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Christina Maslach</span></b>, a psychology graduate student, raised <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ethical objections</span></b>. Zimbardo later analyzed the experiment in a book which compared the events of the Stanford prison to the abuses at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Abu Ghraib</span></b>. Many aspects of the experiment and its legitimacy have been questioned or disputed by contemporary researchers and experiment participants.</li>\n</ul>"

He argued that all human actions could be understood in terms of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">physical stimuli</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">learned responses</span></b>, and that there was no need to study \u2014 or even believe in \u2014 internal mental states or motivations; in fact, doing so could be harmful.

He would take five U.S. Opens and two Australian Opens, but his greatest accomplishments came on the Wimbledon grass. Starting in 1993 he <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">won Wimbledon seven times in eight years</span></b>, losing only to Richard Krajicek in the quarterfinals in 1996. The last Wimbledon win (2000) gave Sampras the all-time men\u2019s major record, passing Roy Emerson\u2019s 12. Married to actress Bridgette Wilson, Sampras silenced his critics (who thought he was washed up) by defeating Andre Agassi for the 2002 U.S. Open title \u2014 then he retired.</li>",

Borg then inexplicably retired at 26; he tried an unsuccessful comeback in the early 1990s. Despite his great success, Borg never won the U.S. Open (reaching the final four times).

Perhaps the greatest returner and baseline player ever, Agassi won his first major on Wimbledon grass in 1992. Briefly married to Brooke Shields, he fell to #141 in the world in 1997, but after they divorced, Agassi rededicated himself to the game. In 1999 he won the French Open, becoming just the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fifth man to complete the career Grand Slam</span></b>.

The degree of broken-ness is rather mild compared to later <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cubist</span></b> works, but it was revolutionary in 1907.

The Christina of the title is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Christina Olson</span></b>, who lived near the Wyeths\u2019 summer home in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cushing, Maine</span></b>.  In the 1948 painting, Christina lays in the cornfield wearing a pink dress, facing away from the viewer, her body partly twisted and hair blowing slightly in the wind.  In the far distance is a three-story farmhouse with dual chimneys and two dormers, along with two sheds to its right.  A distant barn is near the top middle of the painting.  One notable aspect is the subtle pattern of sunlight, which strikes the farmhouse obliquely from the right, shines in the wheel tracks in the upper right, and casts very realistic-looking shadows on Christina\u2019s dress.  The Olson house was the subject of many Andrew Wyeth paintings for 30 years, and it was named to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalregister/\">National Register of Historic Places</a> for its place in <i>Christina\u2019s World</i>.</li>",

One of Caravaggio\u2019s best-known paintings is <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Calling of Saint Matthew</i>, in which Christ, who is at the right, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">points at a group of men sitting at a table</span></b> illuminated by a shaft of light; scholars have debated whether a bearded man at the table is pointing at himself or at the young man sitting next to him. Caravaggio\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Amor Vincit Omnia</i> (meaning \u201cLove Conquers All\u201d) shows a naked <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cupid</span></b> trampling musical instruments and a set of armor. Caravaggio led a violent life; he was forced to flee Rome after being <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sentenced to death for murder</span></b>. Caravaggio was greatly influential during and after his life; artists who imitated or were influenced by his style were known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cCaravaggisti.\u201d</span></b></li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Artemisia Gentileschi</span></b> (1593\u20131656) was an Italian painter whose work includes numerous <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">biblical</span></b> and mythical scenes, as well as many <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">self-portraits</span></b>\u2014including one showing her as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Saint Catherine</span></b> and another showing her at work painting. As a teenager, Gentileschi was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">raped</span></b> by painter Agostino Tassi; during the public trial that resulted after her father <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Orazio</span></b> (also a painter) pressed charges, Gentileschi testified against Tassi while being <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tortured</span></b> to supposedly ensure that her account was truthful. Gentileschi\u2019s most notable works include her depictions of <i class=\"ygk-term\">Judith Slaying Holofernes</i>, in which she showed herself as the biblical slayer of an Assyrian general; she may have also <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">painted Tassi\u2019s face</span></b> on Holofernes. The painting, which was partly inspired by a similar Caravaggio painting, is extremely graphic for its time: <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">blood spurts</span></b> from Holofernes\u2019s neck as Judith coldly saws through it with a sword.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Frans Hals</span></b> (1582\u20131666) was a Dutch painter who worked in the city of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Haarlem</span></b>, and who created some of the best-known portraits of the Dutch Baroque. Many of Hals\u2019s works are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tronies</span></b> (from the Dutch word for \u201cface\u201d), which are portraits in which the subject has an unusual, artificial facial expression or costume. Hals\u2019s best known painting is <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Laughing Cavalier</i>, a 1624 portrait of a man in a wide-brimmed hat and extravagant clothes with an upturned moustache and a bemused expression (notably, the subject of the portrait is not actually laughing); because the subject of the painting looks straight forward, the painting\u2019s eyes seem to follow the viewer. Hals\u2019s other works include a portrait of a <i class=\"ygk-term\">Gypsy Girl</i> in a white shirt and red bodice, as well as <i class=\"ygk-term\">Malle Babbe</i>, which shows a witch-like folk character holding a stein as an owl sits on her shoulder.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Judith Leyster</span></b> (1609\u20131660) was a painter of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dutch Golden Age</span></b> who worked mainly in portraits and genre scenes. Her notable works include <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Proposition</i>, an early <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">feminist</span></b> work in which a woman pointedly ignores a man offering her a handful of gold coins in exchange for sex while she focuses on sewing by candlelight; the footwarmer under her dress indicates she is married and is behaving virtuously. Her <i class=\"ygk-term\">Self-Portrait</i> shows her unrealistically in fine dress, working on a canvas showing a man in blue playing the violin. Leyster was married to fellow artist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jan Miense Molenaer</span></b>; after her death, her work was largely attributed to either her husband or Frans Hals. Leyster was not credited as the painter of her works until the late 1800s.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Nicolas Poussin</span></b> (1594\u20131665) was a French painter who did most of his productive work in Italy. Poussin\u2019s output mainly consisted of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mythical, biblical, and historical scenes</span></b>. Poussin\u2019s notable works include <i class=\"ygk-term\">Et in Arcadia Ego</i>, a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pastoral scene</span></b> showing three shepherds and a woman examining a tomb on which the painting\u2019s title has been carved. The title\u2014a Latin phrase roughly meaning \u201cI am even in Arcadia\u201d\u2014refers to the universal nature of death, and is an artistic <i class=\"ygk-term\">memento mori</i>, or reminder of human mortality. Poussin\u2019s mythology paintings include <i class=\"ygk-term\">A Dance to the Music of Time</i>\u2014which shows Apollo\u2019s chariot in the sky above four figures dancing in a circle as an elderly representation of Time plays a lyre\u2014and a depiction of <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Rape of the Sabine Women</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Rembrandt van Rijn</span></b> (1606\u20131669) was a Dutch painter widely regarded as one of the greatest painters to have ever lived. His <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Night Watch</i> is a massive canvas showing a militia company led by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Frans Banninck Cocq</span></b>, who appears at the painting\u2019s center in a red sash; behind Cocq is a woman with a chicken hanging from her belt. The painting was once larger than it is today; it was cut down to fit into a display space, with the trimmed parts lost. Rembrandt\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp</i> shows the title surgeon using forceps to hold up the muscles of an arm for other physicians to see; the corpse being dissected is that of a recently-executed criminal. Rembrandt is renowned for his many <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">self-portraits</span></b>, both as himself in normal clothing (such as with his <i class=\"ygk-term\">Self-Portrait with Two Circles</i>), and as other characters (including as the title figure in <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Prodigal Son in the Tavern</i>, alongside his wife Saskia).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Peter Paul Rubens</span></b> (1577\u20131640) was a Flemish painter who also served as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diplomat</span></b>; his travels on diplomatic affairs allowed him to study art held in many different areas of Europe. Rubens worked in nearly all major genres of painting of his time, including portraits (such as his numerous depictions of his second wife, Helena Fourment), biblical scenes (such as his 1614 <i class=\"ygk-term\">Descent from the Cross</i>, part of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">triptych</span></b>), mythological works (such as his <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Origin of the Milky Way</i>, a scene also painted by Tintoretto), and various landscapes. Rubens\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\"><i>Marie de\u2019\u00a0Medici</i> cycle</span></b> is a set of 24 portraits and highly allegorical works showing events from the life of Marie de\u2019 Medici, who was the queen of France, wife of Henry\u00a0IV, and mother of Louis\u00a0XIII; the cycle includes <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Coronation in Saint-Denis</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Triumph of Truth</i>. Rubens is known for his many depictions of the nude female body in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">full-figured, fleshy</span></b> state.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Anthony van\u00a0Dyck</span></b> (1599\u20131641) was a Flemish painter who created his most recognizable works while living and working in England. Van\u00a0Dyck trained and worked for many years in the studio of Peter Paul Rubens. In 1632 van Dyck was appointed the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">court painter to Charles\u00a0I of England</span></b>, whom he depicted in numerous portraits, including several equestrian portraits showing the king atop a horse in full black armor. Van Dyck\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Charles\u00a0I at the Hunt</i> shows the king leaning on a walking stick and casually looking over his left shoulder while resting his left hand on his hip, next to a horse that is lowering its head. While in England, van\u00a0Dyck also painted many portraits of English nobility and other court figures, such as his works depicting <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Henrietta Maria</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Princess Mary</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Diego Vel\u00e1zquez</span></b> (1599\u20131660) was the leading Spanish painter of the Baroque era and served as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">court painter to Philip\u00a0IV of Spain</span></b>. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s masterpieces include <i class=\"ygk-term\">Las Meninas</i>, which shows the Infanta Margaret Theresa alongside her maids, dwarfs, and a dog; the painting also includes a self-portrait of Vel\u00e1zquez, who is at work on a large canvas, as well as the king and queen, who appear in a mirror on the background wall. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s mythology-inspired works include the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Rokeby Venus</i> (so named because it was first displayed in England at Rokeby Park), in which a nude reclining Venus gazes at herself in a mirror being held up by Cupid. Vel\u00e1zquez also painted <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Surrender of Breda</i>, showing the moment after a military victory when the Spanish general Ambrogio Spinola was given the key to the title Dutch city.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Johannes Vermeer</span></b> (1632\u20131675) was a Dutch painter who lived and worked in the city of Delft, which he depicted in his 1660 work <i class=\"ygk-term\">View of Delft</i>\u2014one of the earliest prominent examples of a cityscape in painting. Only 34 recognized works by Vermeer have survived to the modern day. Of these, likely the best-known is <i class=\"ygk-term\">Girl With a Pearl Earring</i>, which shows a young woman in a blue and gold turban looking back over her left shoulder, highlighting the title piece of jewelry; the painting inspired a novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier. Vermeer\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Music Lesson</i> shows a young girl with her back to the viewer playing a virginal, as a man standing next to her sings. Vermeer\u2019s works have been the subject of theories advanced by artists and scholars, including British painter <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">David Hockney</span></b>, that claim Vermeer used a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">camera obscura</span></b> to assist in painting his works.</li>",

Hals\u2019s other works include a portrait of a <i class=\"ygk-term\">Gypsy Girl</i> in a white shirt and red bodice, as well as <i class=\"ygk-term\">Malle Babbe</i>, which shows a witch-like folk character holding a stein as an owl sits on her shoulder.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Judith Leyster</span></b> (1609\u20131660) was a painter of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dutch Golden Age</span></b> who worked mainly in portraits and genre scenes. Her notable works include <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Proposition</i>, an early <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">feminist</span></b> work in which a woman pointedly ignores a man offering her a handful of gold coins in exchange for sex while she focuses on sewing by candlelight; the footwarmer under her dress indicates she is married and is behaving virtuously. Her <i class=\"ygk-term\">Self-Portrait</i> shows her unrealistically in fine dress, working on a canvas showing a man in blue playing the violin. Leyster was married to fellow artist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jan Miense Molenaer</span></b>; after her death, her work was largely attributed to either her husband or Frans Hals. Leyster was not credited as the painter of her works until the late 1800s.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Nicolas Poussin</span></b> (1594\u20131665) was a French painter who did most of his productive work in Italy. Poussin\u2019s output mainly consisted of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mythical, biblical, and historical scenes</span></b>. Poussin\u2019s notable works include <i class=\"ygk-term\">Et in Arcadia Ego</i>, a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pastoral scene</span></b> showing three shepherds and a woman examining a tomb on which the painting\u2019s title has been carved. The title\u2014a Latin phrase roughly meaning \u201cI am even in Arcadia\u201d\u2014refers to the universal nature of death, and is an artistic <i class=\"ygk-term\">memento mori</i>, or reminder of human mortality. Poussin\u2019s mythology paintings include <i class=\"ygk-term\">A Dance to the Music of Time</i>\u2014which shows Apollo\u2019s chariot in the sky above four figures dancing in a circle as an elderly representation of Time plays a lyre\u2014and a depiction of <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Rape of the Sabine Women</i>.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Rembrandt van Rijn</span></b> (1606\u20131669) was a Dutch painter widely regarded as one of the greatest painters to have ever lived. His <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Night Watch</i> is a massive canvas showing a militia company led by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Frans Banninck Cocq</span></b>, who appears at the painting\u2019s center in a red sash; behind Cocq is a woman with a chicken hanging from her belt. The painting was once larger than it is today; it was cut down to fit into a display space, with the trimmed parts lost. Rembrandt\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp</i> shows the title surgeon using forceps to hold up the muscles of an arm for other physicians to see; the corpse being dissected is that of a recently-executed criminal. Rembrandt is renowned for his many <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">self-portraits</span></b>, both as himself in normal clothing (such as with his <i class=\"ygk-term\">Self-Portrait with Two Circles</i>), and as other characters (including as the title figure in <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Prodigal Son in the Tavern</i>, alongside his wife Saskia).</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Peter Paul Rubens</span></b> (1577\u20131640) was a Flemish painter who also served as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diplomat</span></b>; his travels on diplomatic affairs allowed him to study art held in many different areas of Europe. Rubens worked in nearly all major genres of painting of his time, including portraits (such as his numerous depictions of his second wife, Helena Fourment), biblical scenes (such as his 1614 <i class=\"ygk-term\">Descent from the Cross</i>, part of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">triptych</span></b>), mythological works (such as his <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Origin of the Milky Way</i>, a scene also painted by Tintoretto), and various landscapes. Rubens\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\"><i>Marie de\u2019\u00a0Medici</i> cycle</span></b> is a set of 24 portraits and highly allegorical works showing events from the life of Marie de\u2019 Medici, who was the queen of France, wife of Henry\u00a0IV, and mother of Louis\u00a0XIII; the cycle includes <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Coronation in Saint-Denis</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Triumph of Truth</i>. Rubens is known for his many depictions of the nude female body in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">full-figured, fleshy</span></b> state.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Anthony van\u00a0Dyck</span></b> (1599\u20131641) was a Flemish painter who created his most recognizable works while living and working in England. Van\u00a0Dyck trained and worked for many years in the studio of Peter Paul Rubens. In 1632 van Dyck was appointed the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">court painter to Charles\u00a0I of England</span></b>, whom he depicted in numerous portraits, including several equestrian portraits showing the king atop a horse in full black armor. Van Dyck\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Charles\u00a0I at the Hunt</i> shows the king leaning on a walking stick and casually looking over his left shoulder while resting his left hand on his hip, next to a horse that is lowering its head. While in England, van\u00a0Dyck also painted many portraits of English nobility and other court figures, such as his works depicting <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Henrietta Maria</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Princess Mary</span></b>.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Diego Vel\u00e1zquez</span></b> (1599\u20131660) was the leading Spanish painter of the Baroque era and served as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">court painter to Philip\u00a0IV of Spain</span></b>. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s masterpieces include <i class=\"ygk-term\">Las Meninas</i>, which shows the Infanta Margaret Theresa alongside her maids, dwarfs, and a dog; the painting also includes a self-portrait of Vel\u00e1zquez, who is at work on a large canvas, as well as the king and queen, who appear in a mirror on the background wall. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s mythology-inspired works include the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Rokeby Venus</i> (so named because it was first displayed in England at Rokeby Park), in which a nude reclining Venus gazes at herself in a mirror being held up by Cupid. Vel\u00e1zquez also painted <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Surrender of Breda</i>, showing the moment after a military victory when the Spanish general Ambrogio Spinola was given the key to the title Dutch city.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Johannes Vermeer</span></b> (1632\u20131675) was a Dutch painter who lived and worked in the city of Delft, which he depicted in his 1660 work <i class=\"ygk-term\">View of Delft</i>\u2014one of the earliest prominent examples of a cityscape in painting. Only 34 recognized works by Vermeer have survived to the modern day. Of these, likely the best-known is <i class=\"ygk-term\">Girl With a Pearl Earring</i>, which shows a young woman in a blue and gold turban looking back over her left shoulder, highlighting the title piece of jewelry; the painting inspired a novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier. Vermeer\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Music Lesson</i> shows a young girl with her back to the viewer playing a virginal, as a man standing next to her sings. Vermeer\u2019s works have been the subject of theories advanced by artists and scholars, including British painter <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">David Hockney</span></b>, that claim Vermeer used a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">camera obscura</span></b> to assist in painting his works.</li>\n</ul>"

The centerpiece of the collection of the Netherlands\u2019 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rijksmuseum</span></b>, this painting depicts a <i class=\"ygk-term\">schutterij</i>, a type of civic guard common in Dutch Golden Age cities. The militia company is led by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Frans Banning Cocq</span></b>, who is depicted in black with a red sash, and his lieutenant <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Willem van Ruytenburch</span></b>, dressed in yellow. Other standout figures in the painting include a small woman in a yellow dress who carries a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dead chicken</span></b>, a symbol of the militia company.

Commonly known as just <i>The Anatomy Lesson</i>. The painting depicts the yearly <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">public dissection</span></b> held by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Amsterdam Guild of Surgeons</span></b>, several of whose members paid commissions in order to be included in the portrait. Tulp\u2019s successor as the city anatomist, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jan Deijman</span></b>, was also depicted by Rembrandt giving an anatomy lesson. The man being dissected is a criminal, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aris Kindt</span></b>, who was hanged for armed robbery. A famous anatomy treatise by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Andreas Vesalius</span></b> can be seen opened at the painting\u2019s bottom right corner. </li>",

The painting shows a scene from the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Book of Daniel</span></b> in which the king of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Babylon</span></b>, Belshazzar, uses the loot his father <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nebuchadnezzar</span></b> stole from the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Temple</span></b> in Jerusalem in order to throw a feast. During the feast, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">God\u2019s hand</span></b> appears and writes a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">prophecy</span></b> on the wall predicting Belshazzar\u2019s downfall\u2014a vision that frightens the onlookers in the painting as well, one of whom is spilling a goblet in horror. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hebrew letters</span></b> in the painting are based on a font created by the Dutch rabbi Menasseh ben Israel, but are written top to bottom instead of right to left.</li>",

The painting is alternatively titled <i>Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman</i>, an exact description of its subject matter. On the floor near the keyboard instrument lies a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">viol</span></b>, a large bowed string instrument also common during the Baroque era. In the documentary <i class=\"ygk-term\">Tim\u2019s Vermeer</i>, Tim Jenison attempted to test the theory that Vermeer painted with the help of optical devices such as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">camera obscura</span></b> to achieve accurate perspective, a theory also advanced by contemporary British artist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">David Hockney</span></b> and physicist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Charles Falco</span></b>.</li>",

The title is misleading, as it actually shows a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">house or kitchen maid</span></b>, rather than a milkmaid working with cows. The painting\u2019s striking features include the tiny stream of milk being poured into a bowl and the intricate folds of the maid\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">blue dress</span></b>. The table, which is covered with a blue cloth, is a Dutch <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gateleg</span></b>, which has an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">octagonal</span></b> shape when unfolded, explaining its odd angles. A foot warmer sits behind the central female figure; in Vermeer\u2019s time, the object would indicate that the woman is single.</li>",

This painting, alternatively known as <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Allegory of Painting</i>, may be either a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">self-portrait</span></b> or a depiction of the artist\u2019s craft; the face of the artist dressed in black, who faces away from the viewer, cannot be seen. The blue-clad model in the painting stands near a window and may be portraying <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Clio</span></b>, the Muse of History; she holds a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">trumpet</span></b> and cradles a large <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">yellow book</span></b> presumed to be <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thucydides</span></b>\u2019 <i class=\"ygk-term\">History of the Peloponnesian War</i>.

The painting\u2019s subject is dressed in fine black clothing appropriate to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Calvinist</span></b> sensibilities of the Dutch Republic, wears a giant white <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">collar</span></b>, has a prominent upturned <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">moustache</span></b>, and is 26 years old according to an inscription at the upper right hand corner.</li>",

The fall of Icarus is not the central image in this painting; the mythological youth\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">legs</span></b> stick out of the water, barely noticed, near a large ship and a fisherman at the bottom right. Most of the painting depicts everyday scenes in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Netherlandish countryside</span></b>, such as a farmer driving a horse while plowing his field and a shepherd staring up at the sky while attending to his sheep. In the distance can be seen a city with a harbor, which the ships in the painting appear to be sailing towards. The painting is famously depicted in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">W.\u00a0H.

Several <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">black birds</span></b> are perched in the barren, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">snowy trees</span></b> above the hunters in this painting, who are returning home with their dogs, having had very little success in their hunt.

His film <i class=\"ygk-term\">Breathless</i> featured a then-unconventional use of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">jump cuts</span></b>, in which footage is removed from the middle of a continuous shot to communicate the passage of time. The film features <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jean-Paul Belmondo</span></b> as Michel, a criminal styling himself after Humphrey Bogart who is sheltered while on the run from the police by Patricia, played by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jean Seberg</span></b>.

Godard continued to make films during the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, shooting the highly experimental 2014 film <i class=\"ygk-term\">Goodbye to Language</i> in 3D.</li>",

The film is about the juvenile delinquent <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Antoine Doinel</span></b>, an alter-ego of sorts of Truffaut, who runs away from home and school, is arrested for stealing a typewriter from his stepfather, and escapes a juvenile detention center in order to see the ocean.
