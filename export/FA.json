Guernica was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Basque</span></b> town bombed by the Germans during the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Spanish Civil War</span></b> in April 1937.  Picasso had already been commissioned to paint a mural for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Spanish Pavilion</span></b> at the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">World\u2019s Fair</span></b>, and he completed his massive, black, white, and grey anti-war mural by early June 1937.  Picasso\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cubist</span></b> approach to portraying the figures adds to the sense of destruction and chaos.  <i>Guernica</i> was in the <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://www.moma.org\">Museum of Modern Art</a> (MOMA) in New York until 1981, when it was returned to the <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"https://www.museoreinasofia.es/en\">Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia</a> in Spain.</li>",

The painting reflects a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cubist</span></b> sense of division of space, and its portrait of motion echoes the work of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Futurists</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><a href=\"http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=79018\"><i class=\"label\">The Persistence of Memory</i></a>, by <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD\">Salvador Dal\u00ed</a>.  First shown in 1931, <i>The Persistence of Memory</i> is probably the most famous <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">surrealist</span></b> painting.  The landscape of the scene echoes the area around <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Portlligat</span></b>, Dal\u00ed\u2019s home.  The ants, flies, clocks, and the Portlligat landscape are motifs in many other Dal\u00ed paintings, and the <i class=\"ygk-term\">trompe l\u2019oeil</i> depiction of figures is typical of his works.  It currently belongs to the <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://www.moma.org\">MOMA</a>; its 1951 companion piece, <a href=\"https://archive.thedali.org/mwebcgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=1652;type=101\"><i class=\"ygk-term\">The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory</i></a>, hangs at the <a href=\"https://thedali.org/\">Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum</a> in St.\u00a0Petersburg, Florida.</li>",

This painting depicts five women in a brothel.  However, the images of the women are partly broken into disjointed, angular facets.  The degree of broken-ness is rather mild compared to later <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cubist</span></b> works, but it was revolutionary in 1907.  The rather phallic fruit arrangement in the foreground reflects the influence of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Paul C\u00e9zanne</span></b>\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cflattening of the canvas.\u201d</span></b>  The two central figures face the viewer, while the other three have primitive masks as faces, reflecting another of Picasso\u2019s influences.  It is currently housed at the <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://www.moma.org\">MOMA</a>.</li>",

While <i class=\"ygk-term\">Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon</i> and other Cubist paintings represent an extension of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Paul C\u00e9zanne</span></b>\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">division-of-space</span></b> approach to the canvas, Mondrian\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">De\u00a0Stijl</span></b> works are a still further abstraction, such that the canvas is often divided up into rectangular \u201ctile patterns,\u201d as in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_with_Red_Blue_and_Yellow\"><i class=\"ygk-term\">Composition with Red Blue and Yellow</i></a>.  The painting simultaneously echoes the bright lights of a marquee, resembles a pattern of streets as seen from above, and creates a feeling of vitality and vibrancy, not unlike the music itself.  This work can also be found at the <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://www.moma.org\">MOMA</a>.</li>",
                "<li><a href=\"http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=79809\"><i class=\"label\">Campbell\u2019s Soup Can</i></a>, by <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol\">Andy Warhol</a>. <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_art\">Pop Art</a> parodies (or perhaps reflects) a world in which celebrities, brand names, and media images have replaced the sacred; Warhol\u2019s series of <i>Campbell\u2019s Soup</i> paintings may be the best illustration of this.  Like the object itself, the paintings were often done by the mass-produceable form of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">serigraphy</span></b> (silk screening).  Also like the subject, the Warhol soup can painting existed in many varieties, with different types of soup or numbers of cans; painting 32 or 100 or 200 identical cans further emphasized the aspect of mass production in the work.  The same approach underlies Warhol\u2019s familiar series of prints of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Marilyn Monroe</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</span></b>, and other pop culture figures.</li>",
                "<li><a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111628/nighthawks\"><i class=\"label\">Nighthawks</i></a>, by <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hopper\">Edward Hopper</a>.  As is often the case with his works, Hopper uses a realistic approach (including such details as the fluorescent light of the diner, the coffee pots, and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Phillies cigar sign</span></b> atop the diner) to convey a sense of a loneliness and isolation, even going so far as to depict the corner store without a door connecting to the larger world.  Hopper\u2019s wife <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jo</span></b> served as the model for the woman at the bar. <i>Nighthawks</i> is housed at the <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://www.artic.edu/\">Art Institute of Chicago</a>.</li>",

Painted in 1911, <i>I and the Village</i> is among Chagall\u2019s earliest surviving paintings.  It is a dreamlike scene that includes many motifs common to Chagall, notably the lamb and peasant life.  In addition to the two giant faces\u2014a green face on the right and a lamb\u2019s head on the left\u2014other images include a milkmaid, a reaper, an upside-down peasant woman, a church, and a series of houses, some of them <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">upside-down</span></b>.  <i>I and the Village</i> is currently housed at <a href=\"http://www.moma.org\">MOMA</a>.</li>",
                "<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina%27s_World\"><i class=\"label\">Christina\u2019s World</i></a>, by <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wyeth\">Andrew Wyeth</a>.  The Christina of the title is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Christina Olson</span></b>, who lived near the Wyeths\u2019 summer home in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cushing, Maine</span></b>.  In the 1948 painting, Christina lays in the cornfield wearing a pink dress, facing away from the viewer, her body partly twisted and hair blowing slightly in the wind.  In the far distance is a three-story farmhouse with dual chimneys and two dormers, along with two sheds to its right.  A distant barn is near the top middle of the painting.  One notable aspect is the subtle pattern of sunlight, which strikes the farmhouse obliquely from the right, shines in the wheel tracks in the upper right, and casts very realistic-looking shadows on Christina\u2019s dress.  The Olson house was the subject of many Andrew Wyeth paintings for 30 years, and it was named to the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalregister/\">National Register of Historic Places</a> for its place in <i>Christina\u2019s World</i>.</li>",
                "<li><a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic\"><i class=\"label\">American Gothic</i></a>, by <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://www.crma.org/Content/Grant-Wood/Gallery.aspx\">Grant Wood</a>.  Wood painted his most famous work after a visit to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eldon, Iowa</span></b>, when he saw a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Carpenter Gothic</span></b>-style house with a distinctive Gothic window in its gable.  Upon returning to his studio, he used his sister <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nan</span></b> and his <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dentist, Dr.\u00a0Byron McKeeby</span></b>, as the models for the two figures.  The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pitchfork</span></b> and the clothing were more typical of 19th-century farmers than contemporary ones. <i>American Gothic</i> is among the most familiar <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">regionalist</span></b> paintings, and it is said to be the most parodied of all paintings.  It hangs at the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Art Institute of Chicago</span></b>, where it was submitted for a competition by Wood upon its completion in 1930 (Wood won a bronze medal and a $300 prize).</li>"

His early homes, like the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robie House</span></b> \u2014 which is adjacent to the campus of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">University of Chicago</span></b> \u2014 are in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cPrairie\u201d style</span></b>: horizontal orientation and low roofs.  His <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201corganic architecture\u201d</span></b> tries to harmonize with its inhabitants and site; examples include the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kaufmann House</span></b> (also known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Fallingwater</span></b>) in Pennsylvania; the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Johnson Wax Building</span></b> in Racine, Wisconsin; and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Taliesin</span></b>, his home and studio in Spring Green, Wisconsin. (There is also a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Taliesin West</span></b>, his home and studio in Arizona.)  Other notable Wright works are the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Guggenheim Museum</span></b> in New York City, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Larkin Building</span></b> in Buffalo, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Unity Temple</span></b> in Oak Park, Illinois, and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Imperial Hotel</span></b> in Tokyo, which was one of few buildings to survive a 1923 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">earthquake</span></b> (though it has since been demolished).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Walter Gropius (1883\u20131969)</span></b> Though Gropius designed the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Fagus Factory</span></b> (Alfeld, Germany) and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pan American Building</span></b> (New York City), he is best known for founding the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bauhaus</span></b>.  Beginning in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Weimar</span></b> in 1919 and moving to a Gropius-designed facility in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dessau</span></b> in 1925, the Bauhaus school emphasized <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">functionalism</span></b>, the application of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">modern methods and materials</span></b>, and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">synthesis of technology and art</span></b>.  Its faculty included artists <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Paul Klee</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Wassily Kandinsky</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Josef Albers</span></b>.

He directed the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bauhaus</span></b> from 1930 to 1933, shutting it down before the Nazis could do so.  His works include the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Barcelona Pavilion</span></b> for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">1929 International Exposition</span></b>; two adjacent apartment buildings at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">860 and 880 North Lake Shore Drive</span></b> in Chicago; the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">New National Gallery</span></b> in Berlin; and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Seagram Building</span></b> in New York, which he co-designed with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Philip Johnson</span></b>.  Mies asserted that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cless is more\u201d</span></b> as a principle of his architectural style. His <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">glass-covered steel</span></b> structures influenced the design of office buildings in nearly every major city in the U.S.</li>",

Though he has also designed moderate-income housing, Pei is best known for large-scale projects.

Charles\u00a0II named him the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">King\u2019s Surveyor of Works</span></b> in 1669, and he was involved in rebuilding more than 50 London <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">churches</span></b> in the next half-century, including <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Saint Paul\u2019s Cathedral</span></b>.

One famous Corbusian quote is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cA house is a machine for living in.\u201d</span></b>  His floor plans were influenced by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cubist</span></b> principles of division of space, and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Villa Savoye</span></b> (Poissy, France) is his best-known early work.  He wrote of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cRadiant City\u201d</span></b> begun anew, a completely planned city with skyscrapers for residents.  Applications of his approach to government buildings (such as in Brasilia or in Chandigarh, India), however, largely failed, as did many urban renewal projects produced on the same ideological foundation.

Though most associated with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chicago</span></b>, his best-known work is the 1891 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Wainwright Building</span></b> in St.\u00a0Louis.  His partnership with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dankmar Adler</span></b> produced over 100 buildings.  Later works, such as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Babson</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bennett</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bradley Houses</span></b>, reflect an organic architecture distinct from that of his onetime employee <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Frank Lloyd Wright</span></b>.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Caravaggio</span></b> (1571\u20131610; full name <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio</span></b>) was an Italian painter who developed a style of painting involving <i class=\"ygk-term\">chiaroscuro</i>, or stark contrast between darkness and vibrant light, that was known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tenebrism</span></b>. One of Caravaggio\u2019s best-known paintings is <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Calling of Saint Matthew</i>, in which Christ, who is at the right, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">points at a group of men sitting at a table</span></b> illuminated by a shaft of light; scholars have debated whether a bearded man at the table is pointing at himself or at the young man sitting next to him. Caravaggio\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Amor Vincit Omnia</i> (meaning \u201cLove Conquers All\u201d) shows a naked <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cupid</span></b> trampling musical instruments and a set of armor. Caravaggio led a violent life; he was forced to flee Rome after being <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sentenced to death for murder</span></b>. Caravaggio was greatly influential during and after his life; artists who imitated or were influenced by his style were known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cCaravaggisti.\u201d</span></b></li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Artemisia Gentileschi</span></b> (1593\u20131656) was an Italian painter whose work includes numerous <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">biblical</span></b> and mythical scenes, as well as many <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">self-portraits</span></b>\u2014including one showing her as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Saint Catherine</span></b> and another showing her at work painting. As a teenager, Gentileschi was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">raped</span></b> by painter Agostino Tassi; during the public trial that resulted after her father <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Orazio</span></b> (also a painter) pressed charges, Gentileschi testified against Tassi while being <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tortured</span></b> to supposedly ensure that her account was truthful. Gentileschi\u2019s most notable works include her depictions of <i class=\"ygk-term\">Judith Slaying Holofernes</i>, in which she showed herself as the biblical slayer of an Assyrian general; she may have also <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">painted Tassi\u2019s face</span></b> on Holofernes. The painting, which was partly inspired by a similar Caravaggio painting, is extremely graphic for its time: <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">blood spurts</span></b> from Holofernes\u2019s neck as Judith coldly saws through it with a sword.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Frans Hals</span></b> (1582\u20131666) was a Dutch painter who worked in the city of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Haarlem</span></b>, and who created some of the best-known portraits of the Dutch Baroque. Many of Hals\u2019s works are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tronies</span></b> (from the Dutch word for \u201cface\u201d), which are portraits in which the subject has an unusual, artificial facial expression or costume. Hals\u2019s best known painting is <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Laughing Cavalier</i>, a 1624 portrait of a man in a wide-brimmed hat and extravagant clothes with an upturned moustache and a bemused expression (notably, the subject of the portrait is not actually laughing); because the subject of the painting looks straight forward, the painting\u2019s eyes seem to follow the viewer. Hals\u2019s other works include a portrait of a <i class=\"ygk-term\">Gypsy Girl</i> in a white shirt and red bodice, as well as <i class=\"ygk-term\">Malle Babbe</i>, which shows a witch-like folk character holding a stein as an owl sits on her shoulder.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Judith Leyster</span></b> (1609\u20131660) was a painter of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dutch Golden Age</span></b> who worked mainly in portraits and genre scenes. Her notable works include <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Proposition</i>, an early <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">feminist</span></b> work in which a woman pointedly ignores a man offering her a handful of gold coins in exchange for sex while she focuses on sewing by candlelight; the footwarmer under her dress indicates she is married and is behaving virtuously. Her <i class=\"ygk-term\">Self-Portrait</i> shows her unrealistically in fine dress, working on a canvas showing a man in blue playing the violin. Leyster was married to fellow artist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jan Miense Molenaer</span></b>; after her death, her work was largely attributed to either her husband or Frans Hals. Leyster was not credited as the painter of her works until the late 1800s.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Nicolas Poussin</span></b> (1594\u20131665) was a French painter who did most of his productive work in Italy. Poussin\u2019s output mainly consisted of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mythical, biblical, and historical scenes</span></b>. Poussin\u2019s notable works include <i class=\"ygk-term\">Et in Arcadia Ego</i>, a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pastoral scene</span></b> showing three shepherds and a woman examining a tomb on which the painting\u2019s title has been carved. The title\u2014a Latin phrase roughly meaning \u201cI am even in Arcadia\u201d\u2014refers to the universal nature of death, and is an artistic <i class=\"ygk-term\">memento mori</i>, or reminder of human mortality. Poussin\u2019s mythology paintings include <i class=\"ygk-term\">A Dance to the Music of Time</i>\u2014which shows Apollo\u2019s chariot in the sky above four figures dancing in a circle as an elderly representation of Time plays a lyre\u2014and a depiction of <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Rape of the Sabine Women</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Rembrandt van Rijn</span></b> (1606\u20131669) was a Dutch painter widely regarded as one of the greatest painters to have ever lived. His <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Night Watch</i> is a massive canvas showing a militia company led by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Frans Banninck Cocq</span></b>, who appears at the painting\u2019s center in a red sash; behind Cocq is a woman with a chicken hanging from her belt. The painting was once larger than it is today; it was cut down to fit into a display space, with the trimmed parts lost. Rembrandt\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp</i> shows the title surgeon using forceps to hold up the muscles of an arm for other physicians to see; the corpse being dissected is that of a recently-executed criminal. Rembrandt is renowned for his many <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">self-portraits</span></b>, both as himself in normal clothing (such as with his <i class=\"ygk-term\">Self-Portrait with Two Circles</i>), and as other characters (including as the title figure in <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Prodigal Son in the Tavern</i>, alongside his wife Saskia).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Peter Paul Rubens</span></b> (1577\u20131640) was a Flemish painter who also served as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diplomat</span></b>; his travels on diplomatic affairs allowed him to study art held in many different areas of Europe. Rubens worked in nearly all major genres of painting of his time, including portraits (such as his numerous depictions of his second wife, Helena Fourment), biblical scenes (such as his 1614 <i class=\"ygk-term\">Descent from the Cross</i>, part of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">triptych</span></b>), mythological works (such as his <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Origin of the Milky Way</i>, a scene also painted by Tintoretto), and various landscapes. Rubens\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\"><i>Marie de\u2019\u00a0Medici</i> cycle</span></b> is a set of 24 portraits and highly allegorical works showing events from the life of Marie de\u2019 Medici, who was the queen of France, wife of Henry\u00a0IV, and mother of Louis\u00a0XIII; the cycle includes <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Coronation in Saint-Denis</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Triumph of Truth</i>.

Van\u00a0Dyck trained and worked for many years in the studio of Peter Paul Rubens. In 1632 van Dyck was appointed the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">court painter to Charles\u00a0I of England</span></b>, whom he depicted in numerous portraits, including several equestrian portraits showing the king atop a horse in full black armor. Van Dyck\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Charles\u00a0I at the Hunt</i> shows the king leaning on a walking stick and casually looking over his left shoulder while resting his left hand on his hip, next to a horse that is lowering its head. While in England, van\u00a0Dyck also painted many portraits of English nobility and other court figures, such as his works depicting <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Henrietta Maria</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Princess Mary</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Diego Vel\u00e1zquez</span></b> (1599\u20131660) was the leading Spanish painter of the Baroque era and served as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">court painter to Philip\u00a0IV of Spain</span></b>. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s masterpieces include <i class=\"ygk-term\">Las Meninas</i>, which shows the Infanta Margaret Theresa alongside her maids, dwarfs, and a dog; the painting also includes a self-portrait of Vel\u00e1zquez, who is at work on a large canvas, as well as the king and queen, who appear in a mirror on the background wall. Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s mythology-inspired works include the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Rokeby Venus</i> (so named because it was first displayed in England at Rokeby Park), in which a nude reclining Venus gazes at herself in a mirror being held up by Cupid. Vel\u00e1zquez also painted <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Surrender of Breda</i>, showing the moment after a military victory when the Spanish general Ambrogio Spinola was given the key to the title Dutch city.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Johannes Vermeer</span></b> (1632\u20131675) was a Dutch painter who lived and worked in the city of Delft, which he depicted in his 1660 work <i class=\"ygk-term\">View of Delft</i>\u2014one of the earliest prominent examples of a cityscape in painting. Only 34 recognized works by Vermeer have survived to the modern day. Of these, likely the best-known is <i class=\"ygk-term\">Girl With a Pearl Earring</i>, which shows a young woman in a blue and gold turban looking back over her left shoulder, highlighting the title piece of jewelry; the painting inspired a novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier. Vermeer\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Music Lesson</i> shows a young girl with her back to the viewer playing a virginal, as a man standing next to her sings. Vermeer\u2019s works have been the subject of theories advanced by artists and scholars, including British painter <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">David Hockney</span></b>, that claim Vermeer used a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">camera obscura</span></b> to assist in painting his works.</li>",
                "<ul class=\"ygk\">\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Caravaggio</span></b> (1571\u20131610; full name <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio</span></b>) was an Italian painter who developed a style of painting involving <i class=\"ygk-term\">chiaroscuro</i>, or stark contrast between darkness and vibrant light, that was known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tenebrism</span></b>. One of Caravaggio\u2019s best-known paintings is <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Calling of Saint Matthew</i>, in which Christ, who is at the right, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">points at a group of men sitting at a table</span></b> illuminated by a shaft of light; scholars have debated whether a bearded man at the table is pointing at himself or at the young man sitting next to him. Caravaggio\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Amor Vincit Omnia</i> (meaning \u201cLove Conquers All\u201d) shows a naked <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cupid</span></b> trampling musical instruments and a set of armor. Caravaggio led a violent life; he was forced to flee Rome after being <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sentenced to death for murder</span></b>. Caravaggio was greatly influential during and after his life; artists who imitated or were influenced by his style were known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cCaravaggisti.\u201d</span></b></li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Artemisia Gentileschi</span></b> (1593\u20131656) was an Italian painter whose work includes numerous <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">biblical</span></b> and mythical scenes, as well as many <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">self-portraits</span></b>\u2014including one showing her as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Saint Catherine</span></b> and another showing her at work painting. As a teenager, Gentileschi was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">raped</span></b> by painter Agostino Tassi; during the public trial that resulted after her father <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Orazio</span></b> (also a painter) pressed charges, Gentileschi testified against Tassi while being <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tortured</span></b> to supposedly ensure that her account was truthful. Gentileschi\u2019s most notable works include her depictions of <i class=\"ygk-term\">Judith Slaying Holofernes</i>, in which she showed herself as the biblical slayer of an Assyrian general; she may have also <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">painted Tassi\u2019s face</span></b> on Holofernes. The painting, which was partly inspired by a similar Caravaggio painting, is extremely graphic for its time: <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">blood spurts</span></b> from Holofernes\u2019s neck as Judith coldly saws through it with a sword.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Frans Hals</span></b> (1582\u20131666) was a Dutch painter who worked in the city of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Haarlem</span></b>, and who created some of the best-known portraits of the Dutch Baroque. Many of Hals\u2019s works are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tronies</span></b> (from the Dutch word for \u201cface\u201d), which are portraits in which the subject has an unusual, artificial facial expression or costume. Hals\u2019s best known painting is <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Laughing Cavalier</i>, a 1624 portrait of a man in a wide-brimmed hat and extravagant clothes with an upturned moustache and a bemused expression (notably, the subject of the portrait is not actually laughing); because the subject of the painting looks straight forward, the painting\u2019s eyes seem to follow the viewer. Hals\u2019s other works include a portrait of a <i class=\"ygk-term\">Gypsy Girl</i> in a white shirt and red bodice, as well as <i class=\"ygk-term\">Malle Babbe</i>, which shows a witch-like folk character holding a stein as an owl sits on her shoulder.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Judith Leyster</span></b> (1609\u20131660) was a painter of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dutch Golden Age</span></b> who worked mainly in portraits and genre scenes. Her notable works include <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Proposition</i>, an early <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">feminist</span></b> work in which a woman pointedly ignores a man offering her a handful of gold coins in exchange for sex while she focuses on sewing by candlelight; the footwarmer under her dress indicates she is married and is behaving virtuously. Her <i class=\"ygk-term\">Self-Portrait</i> shows her unrealistically in fine dress, working on a canvas showing a man in blue playing the violin. Leyster was married to fellow artist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jan Miense Molenaer</span></b>; after her death, her work was largely attributed to either her husband or Frans Hals. Leyster was not credited as the painter of her works until the late 1800s.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Nicolas Poussin</span></b> (1594\u20131665) was a French painter who did most of his productive work in Italy. Poussin\u2019s output mainly consisted of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mythical, biblical, and historical scenes</span></b>. Poussin\u2019s notable works include <i class=\"ygk-term\">Et in Arcadia Ego</i>, a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pastoral scene</span></b> showing three shepherds and a woman examining a tomb on which the painting\u2019s title has been carved. The title\u2014a Latin phrase roughly meaning \u201cI am even in Arcadia\u201d\u2014refers to the universal nature of death, and is an artistic <i class=\"ygk-term\">memento mori</i>, or reminder of human mortality. Poussin\u2019s mythology paintings include <i class=\"ygk-term\">A Dance to the Music of Time</i>\u2014which shows Apollo\u2019s chariot in the sky above four figures dancing in a circle as an elderly representation of Time plays a lyre\u2014and a depiction of <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Rape of the Sabine Women</i>.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Rembrandt van Rijn</span></b> (1606\u20131669) was a Dutch painter widely regarded as one of the greatest painters to have ever lived. His <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Night Watch</i> is a massive canvas showing a militia company led by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Frans Banninck Cocq</span></b>, who appears at the painting\u2019s center in a red sash; behind Cocq is a woman with a chicken hanging from her belt. The painting was once larger than it is today; it was cut down to fit into a display space, with the trimmed parts lost. Rembrandt\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp</i> shows the title surgeon using forceps to hold up the muscles of an arm for other physicians to see; the corpse being dissected is that of a recently-executed criminal. Rembrandt is renowned for his many <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">self-portraits</span></b>, both as himself in normal clothing (such as with his <i class=\"ygk-term\">Self-Portrait with Two Circles</i>), and as other characters (including as the title figure in <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Prodigal Son in the Tavern</i>, alongside his wife Saskia).</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Peter Paul Rubens</span></b> (1577\u20131640) was a Flemish painter who also served as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diplomat</span></b>; his travels on diplomatic affairs allowed him to study art held in many different areas of Europe. Rubens worked in nearly all major genres of painting of his time, including portraits (such as his numerous depictions of his second wife, Helena Fourment), biblical scenes (such as his 1614 <i class=\"ygk-term\">Descent from the Cross</i>, part of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">triptych</span></b>), mythological works (such as his <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Origin of the Milky Way</i>, a scene also painted by Tintoretto), and various landscapes. Rubens\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\"><i>Marie de\u2019\u00a0Medici</i> cycle</span></b> is a set of 24 portraits and highly allegorical works showing events from the life of Marie de\u2019 Medici, who was the queen of France, wife of Henry\u00a0IV, and mother of Louis\u00a0XIII; the cycle includes <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Coronation in Saint-Denis</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Triumph of Truth</i>. Rubens is known for his many depictions of the nude female body in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">full-figured, fleshy</span></b> state.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Anthony van\u00a0Dyck</span></b> (1599\u20131641) was a Flemish painter who created his most recognizable works while living and working in England. Van\u00a0Dyck trained and worked for many years in the studio of Peter Paul Rubens.

The centerpiece of the collection of the Netherlands\u2019 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rijksmuseum</span></b>, this painting depicts a <i class=\"ygk-term\">schutterij</i>, a type of civic guard common in Dutch Golden Age cities.

Commonly known as just <i>The Anatomy Lesson</i>. The painting depicts the yearly <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">public dissection</span></b> held by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Amsterdam Guild of Surgeons</span></b>, several of whose members paid commissions in order to be included in the portrait. Tulp\u2019s successor as the city anatomist, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jan Deijman</span></b>, was also depicted by Rembrandt giving an anatomy lesson. The man being dissected is a criminal, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aris Kindt</span></b>, who was hanged for armed robbery. A famous anatomy treatise by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Andreas Vesalius</span></b> can be seen opened at the painting\u2019s bottom right corner. </li>",

The painting shows a scene from the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Book of Daniel</span></b> in which the king of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Babylon</span></b>, Belshazzar, uses the loot his father <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nebuchadnezzar</span></b> stole from the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Temple</span></b> in Jerusalem in order to throw a feast.

The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hebrew letters</span></b> in the painting are based on a font created by the Dutch rabbi Menasseh ben Israel, but are written top to bottom instead of right to left.</li>",

The painting is alternatively titled <i>Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman</i>, an exact description of its subject matter. On the floor near the keyboard instrument lies a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">viol</span></b>, a large bowed string instrument also common during the Baroque era. In the documentary <i class=\"ygk-term\">Tim\u2019s Vermeer</i>, Tim Jenison attempted to test the theory that Vermeer painted with the help of optical devices such as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">camera obscura</span></b> to achieve accurate perspective, a theory also advanced by contemporary British artist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">David Hockney</span></b> and physicist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Charles Falco</span></b>.</li>",

The title is misleading, as it actually shows a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">house or kitchen maid</span></b>, rather than a milkmaid working with cows. The painting\u2019s striking features include the tiny stream of milk being poured into a bowl and the intricate folds of the maid\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">blue dress</span></b>. The table, which is covered with a blue cloth, is a Dutch <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gateleg</span></b>, which has an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">octagonal</span></b> shape when unfolded, explaining its odd angles. A foot warmer sits behind the central female figure; in Vermeer\u2019s time, the object would indicate that the woman is single.</li>",

This painting, alternatively known as <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Allegory of Painting</i>, may be either a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">self-portrait</span></b> or a depiction of the artist\u2019s craft; the face of the artist dressed in black, who faces away from the viewer, cannot be seen. The blue-clad model in the painting stands near a window and may be portraying <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Clio</span></b>, the Muse of History; she holds a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">trumpet</span></b> and cradles a large <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">yellow book</span></b> presumed to be <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thucydides</span></b>\u2019 <i class=\"ygk-term\">History of the Peloponnesian War</i>.

The painting\u2019s subject is dressed in fine black clothing appropriate to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Calvinist</span></b> sensibilities of the Dutch Republic, wears a giant white <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">collar</span></b>, has a prominent upturned <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">moustache</span></b>, and is 26 years old according to an inscription at the upper right hand corner.</li>",

The fall of Icarus is not the central image in this painting; the mythological youth\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">legs</span></b> stick out of the water, barely noticed, near a large ship and a fisherman at the bottom right. Most of the painting depicts everyday scenes in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Netherlandish countryside</span></b>, such as a farmer driving a horse while plowing his field and a shepherd staring up at the sky while attending to his sheep. In the distance can be seen a city with a harbor, which the ships in the painting appear to be sailing towards. The painting is famously depicted in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">W.\u00a0H.

Several <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">black birds</span></b> are perched in the barren, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">snowy trees</span></b> above the hunters in this painting, who are returning home with their dogs, having had very little success in their hunt.

The film is about the juvenile delinquent <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Antoine Doinel</span></b>, an alter-ego of sorts of Truffaut, who runs away from home and school, is arrested for stealing a typewriter from his stepfather, and escapes a juvenile detention center in order to see the ocean.

Dido, who has fallen in love with the Trojan prince Aeneas, is heartbroken when she learns that he is planning to leave because of what he believes in an order from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mercury</span></b>. Dido sings this aria as she is dying of grief following Aeneas\u2019s departure, after a recitative in which she asks for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cThy hand, Belinda\u201d</span></b> (her sister and handmaiden). In her aria, she urges <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cRemember me, but ah! Forget my fate.\u201d</span></b> The aria uses a chromatic <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201clament bass,\u201d</span></b> a common feature in Baroque opera involving a descent from tonic to dominant in a minor key, first introduced by Claudio Monteverdi.</li>",

The aria is renowned as one of the most spectacular and most difficult soprano arias in the common repertoire; it requires the singer to not only hit several staccato high Cs in succession, but also for the singer to leap up to the F higher than that. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Josepha Hofer</span></b>, Mozart\u2019s sister-in-law, played the Queen at the premiere of <i>The Magic Flute</i>; Mozart wrote \u201cDer H\u00f6lle Rache\u201d to showcase her high range.</li>",

This is Figaro\u2019s first major aria of the opera, and he sings it when he first appears on stage. In it, he describes himself as a \u201cbarber of quality,\u201d notes that \u201ceveryone asks for me,\u201d and describes himself as equally skilled with a \u201cyoung lady\u201d as he is with \u201crazors and combs.\u201d Figaro sings this as he is walking along the street; he is subsequently approached by Lindoro\u2014really, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Count Almaviva</span></b> in disguise\u2014who asks for Figaro\u2019s help in wooing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rosina</span></b>, the ward of the elderly Doctor Bartolo.

Donizetti maximized the eerie nature of the scene by calling for a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">glass harmonica</span></b> in the accompaniment. \u201cIl dolce suono\u201d was a signature piece for soprano <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joan Sutherland</span></b>.</li>",

The aria is in the style of an <i class=\"ygk-term\">habanera</i>, a dance developed in Cuba (and whose name refers to the city of Havana), and is often simply known by the name of the dance. Bizet adapted the aria\u2019s music from a piece by composer <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sebasti\u00e1n Iradier</span></b>, thinking it was a traditional folk melody rather than an original work. In the aria, Carmen sings that \u201clove is a rebellious bird that no one can tame\u201d to a seductive, chromatically-descending melody, proclaiming <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cif you don\u2019t love me, then I love you\u201d</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cif I love you, be on your guard.\u201d</span></b> At the end of the aria, Carmen throws a flower to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Don Jos\u00e9</span></b>, who subsequently falls in love with her and eventually kills her.</li>",

The Chinese princess Turandot swears she will only wed any man who can answer her <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">three riddles</span></b>; she executes any who fail. The disguised Prince Calaf correctly answers Turandot\u2019s riddles and poses one of his own: if she can <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">learn his name</span></b> by sunrise, then she can still execute him. Calaf sings \u201cNessun Dorma\u201d as all of Turandot\u2019s subjects frantically try to discover his name.

A languid, undulating harmony accompanies Clara, as she sings \u201c<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Summertime and the livin\u2019 is easy</span></b> / fish are jumpin\u2019, and the cotton is high.\u201d Clara and her husband Jake die in a hurricane at the end of Act\u00a0II; in Act\u00a0III, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bess</span></b> reprises \u201cSummertime\u201d by singing it to their baby, who is now an orphan. Gershwin wrote \u201cSummertime\u201d in an attempt to capture the feel of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Black spiritual</span></b>; the piece subsequently became a jazz standard. The lyrics for \u201cSummertime\u201d were written by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">DuBose Heyward</span></b>, who also wrote the novel on which the opera is based.</li>",

Because <i>Appalachian Spring</i> was first performed in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Library of Congress</span></b>, Copland was forced to limit the accompanying ensemble to just thirteen musicians.

Their presence is usually signified by one of the ballet\u2019s recurring musical themes, a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">B-minor motif for oboe and harp</span></b>. Odette and Siegfried begin to fall in love, but morning breaks and Odette returns to her swan form.

A virtuoso pianist and an innovative composer, Bart\u00f3k refused to teach composition, contributing to financial problems, especially after he fled Nazi-allied Hungary for the U.S. in 1940.

His <i class=\"ygk-term\">Imaginary Landscape No.\u00a04</i> (1951) used twelve radios tuned to different stations; the composition depended on what was on the radio at that time.  The following year\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">4\u203233\u2033</i> required a pianist to sit at the piano for that length of time and then close it; audience noise and silence created the music.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Miles Davis</span></b> (1926\u20131991) was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">trumpeter</span></b> who developed or influenced the development of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cool jazz</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">modal jazz</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">hard bop</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">electronic jazz</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">jazz fusion</span></b> over his long career. Davis\u2019s 1959 modal jazz album <i class=\"ygk-term\">Kind of Blue</i>\u2014which he recorded with the members of his <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">First Great Quintet</span></b> (which generally existed in the later 1950s), including <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Coltrane</span></b>\u2014is widely considered to be the greatest jazz recording of all time. It includes the track <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylXk1LBvIqU\">\u201cSo What.\u201d</a> Davis\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Second Great Quintet</span></b> (1960s) featured <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Herbie Hancock</span></b> on piano and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Wayne Shorter</span></b> on sax and formed the core of the group that recorded Davis\u2019s album <i class=\"ygk-term\">In a Silent Way</i>, which marked Davis\u2019s first use of electric instruments and first venture into a more rock-and-roll fusion aesthetic. Davis\u2019s early career was marked by his struggles with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">heroin addiction</span></b>. His other notable albums include <i class=\"ygk-term\">Sketches of Spain</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">Birth of the Cool</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">John Coltrane</span></b> (1926\u20131967) was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">saxophonist</span></b> who was an influential figure in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">hard bop</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">modal jazz</span></b>. Coltrane played saxophone on many other musicians\u2019s landmark albums; for example, he was the tenor sax player on Miles Davis\u2019s album <i>Kind of Blue</i>. His own major albums included <i class=\"ygk-term\">Giant Steps</i>, whose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30FTr6G53VU\">title track</a> features chords that move down by major thirds (and which became known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Coltrane changes</span></b>) and a sax solo that led Coltrane\u2019s playing to be described as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201csheets of sound.\u201d</span></b> Coltrane\u2019s quartet, which usually included pianist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">McCoy Tyner</span></b> and drummer <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Elvin Jones</span></b>, produced the album <i class=\"ygk-term\">My Favorite Things</i>, whose title track is a cover of a song from <i>The Sound of Music</i>. Coltrane experienced a religious awakening while overcoming his addiction to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">heroin</span></b>; his album <i class=\"ygk-term\">A Love Supreme</i> concludes with Coltrane \u201cnarrating\u201d the words of a devotional poem via his sax playing. Following his death at age 40, Coltrane was named a saint of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">African Orthodox Church</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Louis Armstrong</span></b> (1901\u20131971) was a renowned <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cornet and trumpet player</span></b>, nicknamed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cSatchmo\u201d</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cPops.\u201d</span></b> Armstrong grew up in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">New Orleans</span></b> and is among the best-known performers of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dixieland</span></b> style of jazz. Armstrong got early experience playing in bands led by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kid Ory</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">King Oliver</span></b> before heading up his own group known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cHot Five,\u201d</span></b> whose members included both Kid Ory and Armstrong\u2019s then-wife, pianist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lil Hardin Armstrong</span></b>. The Hot Five\u2019s recording of the track <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYI9dPyZ7lw\">\u201cHeebie Jeebies\u201d</a> features Armstrong\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">scat singing</span></b>, or singing using random, nonsense syllables. Armstrong was a renowned vocalist as well as instrumentalist, with his recordings of the songs <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cWhat a Wonderful World\u201d</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d</span></b> His notable instrumental jazz compositions include <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cPotato Head Blues.\u201d</span></b></li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Charlie Parker</span></b> (1920\u20131955) was an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">alto saxophone</span></b> virtuoso who helped develop the jazz style known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bebop</span></b>, which generally featured a fast tempo, rapid modulations, and thicker chords than the earlier swing style. Parker was nicknamed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBird\u201d</span></b> or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cYardbird\u201d</span></b>; although the origins of this nickname are disputed, one popular tale involves Parker cooking and eating a chicken that had been hit by a bus. Parker referenced his nickname in the titles of many of his compositions, such as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cOrnithology,\u201d</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cYardbird Suite,\u201d</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBird Gets the Worm.\u201d</span></b> Parker\u2019s recording of his composition <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cKo-Ko\u201d</span></b> features Miles Davis on trumpet; his composition <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7USMqAH8qk\">\u201cBlues for Alice\u201d</a> features a chord progression that heavily uses ii-V-I progressions and has become known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bird blues</span></b> or the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bird changes</span></b>. Parker died at the age of 34 following a long history of drug and alcohol abuse.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Edward Kennedy \u201cDuke\u201d Ellington</span></b> (1899\u20131974) was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pianist and bandleader</span></b> who wrote and recorded some of the most popular jazz standards of all time. Ellington often collaborated with arranger <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Billy Strayhorn</span></b>, who wrote what would become Ellington\u2019s signature tune, <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6mFGy4g_n8\">\u201cTake the \u2018A\u2019 Train\u201d</a> (whose title refers to how to travel to Sugar Hill in Harlem). Ellington\u2019s other compositions that became jazz standards include <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cIt Don\u2019t Mean a Thing (If It Ain\u2019t Got That Swing),\u201d</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cMood Indigo,\u201d</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cPrelude to a Kiss.\u201d</span></b> Ellington also performed and popularized works by his band\u2019s members, such as trombonist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Juan Tizol</span></b>\u2019s track <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cCaravan.\u201d</span></b> Ellington\u2019s work as a composer extended beyond his own concert works: he wrote the score for the 1959 film <i class=\"ygk-term\">Anatomy of a Murder</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Dave Brubeck</span></b> (1920\u20132012) was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pianist</span></b> whose lengthy career helped define the style of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cool jazz</span></b>. For most of his career, Brubeck led the eponymous Dave Brubeck Quartet; the quartet\u2019s best known lineup, from the late 1950s through the 1960s, included <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Paul Desmond</span></b> (sax), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eugene Wright</span></b> (bass), and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joe Morello</span></b> (drums). With this lineup, Brubeck\u2019s quartet recorded the landmark 1959 album <i class=\"ygk-term\">Time Out</i>, which utilized <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">non-traditional time signatures</span></b> inspired by the folk music of Eastern Europe and Asia. The album\u2019s best-known track is <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryA6eHZNnXY\">\u201cTake Five,\u201d</a> a work in 5/4\u00a0time written by Paul Desmond. Brubeck continued to explore unusual time signatures on the follow-up albums <i class=\"ygk-term\">Time Further Out</i> (1961) and <i class=\"ygk-term\">Time Changes</i> (1964). Brubeck\u2019s own notable compositions include <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBlue Rondo a la Turk,\u201d</span></b> which subdivides measures of 9/8\u00a0time into a \u201c2+2+2+3\u201d grouping.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Benny Goodman</span></b> (1909\u20131986) was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">clarinetist</span></b> nicknamed the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cKing of Swing\u201d</span></b> for his association with the style. Goodman made more impact on jazz as a bandleader and performer of the works of others rather than as a composer himself; his orchestra\u2019s signature tune was Louis Prima\u2019s <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_E0UVNtJ9Y\">\u201cSing, Sing, Sing (With a Swing),\u201d</a> best-known from a 1937 recording featuring an extended drum solo by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Gene Krupa</span></b>. Goodman led his band in a landmark 1938 concert at New York\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Carnegie Hall</span></b>, the first time a jazz band had ever played in the venue; the event was widely seen as \u201clegitimizing\u201d jazz as a genre. Goodman did not limit himself to performing only jazz music: he was the clarinet soloist at the premiere of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Leonard Bernstein</span></b>\u2019s work <i>Prelude, Fugue, and Riffs</i>, and he commissioned <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aaron Copland</span></b>\u2019s Clarinet Concerto.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">John Birks \u201cDizzy\u201d Gillespie</span></b> (1917\u20131993) was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">trumpet</span></b> player who was a leading figure in the development of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bebop</span></b>. Gillespie notably performed using a trumpet whose <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bell was bent upwards</span></b>; according to Gillespie, his standard trumpet was damaged by someone falling on it in 1953, causing the bell to bend, and he liked the way it changed the instrument\u2019s tone. He was also notable for performing with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">puffed-out cheeks</span></b>. Gillespie\u2019s composition <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cSalt Peanuts\u201d</span></b> features him yelling the title nonsense <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">scat</span></b> lyrics during the tune. Gillespie\u2019s other bebop compositions that became jazz standards include <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkemox0461U\">\u201cA Night in Tunisia\u201d</a> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cGroovin\u2019 High.\u201d</span></b> Gillespie\u2019s 1947 work <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cManteca,\u201d</span></b> which he co-wrote with percussionist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chano Pozo</span></b>, was a landmark in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Afro-Cuban jazz</span></b>, the first genre of jazz to integrate Latin rhythms and influences.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Charles Mingus</span></b> (1922\u20131979) is arguably the most influential player of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">double bass</span></b> in the history of jazz. Mingus\u2019s compositions often feature sections of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">free improvisation</span></b>, in which the musicians improvise without any planned chord changes or formal structure. His 1959 album <i class=\"ygk-term\">Mingus Ah Um</i> includes his work <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT2-iobVcdw\">\u201cFables of Faubus,\u201d</a> a protest against Arkansas governor Orval Faubus\u2019s resistance to school integration\u2014though Columbia Records refused to allow the lyrics to be included on the album. Mingus\u2019s other albums include <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady</i>, a single continuous piece originally conceived as a ballet. Near the end of his life, Mingus was diagnosed with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ALS</span></b>, which eventually left him unable to perform in the years before his death.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Buddy Rich</span></b> (1917\u20131987) was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">drummer and big band leader</span></b> renowned for his near-perfect playing technique. Rich did not read music; he learned completely <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">by ear</span></b>. Rich did not form his own big band until the mid-1960s; prior to this, he played drums for many of jazz\u2019s other greats, including <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Count Basie</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Charlie Parker</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Artie Shaw</span></b>. Rich often engaged in \u201cdrum battles\u201d with other jazz drummers, most notably <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Gene Krupa</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Max Roach</span></b>; he also appeared on an episode of the TV series <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Muppets</i> to engage in a drum battle with Animal. Rich\u2019s recordings with his own big band include the 1968 album <i class=\"ygk-term\">Mercy, Mercy</i> (whose title is a reference to the Cannonball Adderley hit \u201cMercy, Mercy, Mercy\u201d) and the 1975 album <i class=\"ygk-term\">Big Band Machine</i>, which included a version of the <i>West Side Story</i> melody that was one of Rich\u2019s signature pieces.</li>"

            "Music Theory Terms",
            [
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Tempo</span></b>: Traditionally, the tempo, or speed, of a piece is indicated through the use of Italian-language terms. Some of the most common tempo markings are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">largo</span></b> (very slow), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">adagio</span></b> (slow), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">andante</span></b> (\u201cwalking speed\u201d), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">allegro</span></b> (fast), and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">presto</span></b> (very fast). A work\u2019s tempo may also be indicated by a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">metronome marking</span></b>, which indicates the number of a certain type of note per minute (e.g., quarter note\u00a0=\u00a0120). Tempos are often modified with further Italian terms, such as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">allegro con fuoco</span></b> (fast, with fire), which can make them more unique. Movements from larger works are often referred to by their tempo (e.g. \u201cthe <i class=\"ygk-term\">Allegretto</i> from Beethoven\u2019s 7th symphony\u201d); entire works may also be named for their tempo (e.g., Samuel Barber\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Adagio for Strings</i>).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Scales</span></b>: The two most common types of scales are the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">major and minor scales</span></b>, both of which are referred to as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diatonic</span></b>, meaning that they have seven notes between octaves and follow a repeating pattern of whole steps and half steps. While there is only one major scale, there are three common variants of the minor scale: <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">natural</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">harmonic</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">melodic</span></b>. The individual notes within a scale are given numeric indications known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">scale degrees</span></b>, starting with \u201c1\u201d and moving up the scale note by note; the most prominent of these are the first degree, or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tonic</span></b> (the \u201chome\u201d pitch), and the fifth degree, or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dominant</span></b>. There is also the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">chromatic scale</span></b>, which includes every note between two endpoints, including sharps and flats.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Intervals</span></b>: At the most basic level, intervals \u2014 the distance between two pitches \u2014 are described with ordinal numbers (second, third, etc.), with the exceptions of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unisons</span></b> (two of the exact same note, which would logically have been called a \u201cfirst\u201d) and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">octaves</span></b> (which would have been called an \u201ceighth\u201d). The easiest way to find the basic interval between two pitches is to start on the bottom pitch, label that line or space \u201c1,\u201d and then count lines and spaces upwards until the next pitch is reached; for example, the interval between C and F is a fourth: C is counted as \u201c1,\u201d the lines/spaces for D and E are counted as \u201c2\u201d and \u201c3,\u201d and the line/space for F is reached on \u201c4.\u201d Unisons, fourths, fifths, and octaves may be classified as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">perfect</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">augmented</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diminished</span></b>; seconds, thirds, sixths, and sevenths may be classified as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">major</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">minor</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">augmented</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diminished</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Chords</span></b>: The most common types of chords are built of successive notes that are each a third above the previous. A <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">triad</span></b> consists of three notes referred to as the root, third, and fifth\u2014the third and fifth being that respective interval above the root. Triads are classified as either <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">major</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">minor</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">augmented</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diminished</span></b>, based on whether the successive pitches are separated by major or minor thirds. Adding another third above the fifth results in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">seventh chord</span></b> (since that new pitch is a seventh above the root). Although many types of seventh chords are possible, the most common are the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">major</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">major-minor</span></b> (or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dominant</span></b>), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">minor</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">half-diminished</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fully-diminished</span></b>. Larger chords, such as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ninth</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">thirteenth</span></b> chords, appear commonly in jazz.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Key</span></b>: A piece of music\u2019s key is the \u201chome\u201d scale of the work. The key is most often indicated by the work\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">key signature</span></b>, a collection of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sharps</span></b> or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">flats</span></b> that appears at the beginning of the work and on each subsequent line of music (a list of key signatures may be found <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signature#Table\">here</a>). A pair of keys may be <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">parallel</span></b> (beginning on the same pitch, e.g., C\u00a0major and C\u00a0minor), or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">relative</span></b> (having the same key signature, e.g., C\u00a0major and A\u00a0minor). Most works of music between the Baroque and Romantic periods end in the same key as they begin, with the exception that works that start in a minor key may end in the parallel major. A work\u2019s key is often used as a descriptor in its title (e.g. Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No.\u00a05 in C\u00a0minor).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Transposition</span></b>: Instruments that are in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">concert pitch</span></b>, or \u201cin C,\u201d have their music written at the same pitch in which they sound. Concert pitch instruments include the piano, all string instruments, the flute, and nearly every woodwind and brass instrument that plays in bass clef. Other instruments are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">transposing instruments</span></b>, meaning that their music is written at a different pitch than they sound. With few exceptions, music for transposing instruments is written <em>above</em> the sounding pitch, which can be determined by moving down the interval that the instrument\u2019s key is <em>below</em> C. For example, the French horn is in F, a perfect fifth below C; thus, a French horn playing a written G\u00a0natural would sound a C\u00a0natural, the pitch a perfect fifth below G\u00a0natural. Similarly, a B-flat trumpet playing a written D would sound a C, a major second below.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Dynamics</span></b>: Dynamic markings indicate the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">volume</span></b> at which music is to be played. The two most basic dynamic markings are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">forte</span></b>, meaning \u201cloud,\u201d and abbreviated <i class=\"ygk-term\">f</i>; and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">piano</span></b>, meaning \u201csoft,\u201d and abbreviated <i class=\"ygk-term\">p</i>. These indications are often modified by the word <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mezzo</span></b> (abbreviated <i class=\"ygk-term\">m</i>); thus, <i class=\"ygk-term\">mf</i> indicates \u201cmezzo forte,\u201d meaning \u201cmedium loud.\u201d They may also be modified by the suffix <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">-issimo</span></b>, meaning \u201cvery,\u201d and symbolized by two of the same letter; thus, <i class=\"ygk-term\">pp</i> would indicate <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pianissimo</span></b>, meaning \u201cvery soft.\u201d Gradual changes in volume are indicated by a <i class=\"ygk-term\">crescendo</i>, meaning gradually getting louder, or a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diminuendo</span></b> (also called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">decrescendo</span></b>), meaning gradually getting softer.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Articulation</span></b>: Articulation refers to the various techniques which may be used to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">modify</span></b> the attack or performance of a single note or a series of notes. Some of the most common articulations include <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">staccato</span></b>, meaning light or short; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tenuto</span></b>, meaning a note is to be held its entire value; and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">legato</span></b>, meaning a series of notes is to be connected to one another very smoothly. Single notes may be given extra force by an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">accent mark</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Form</span></b>: A work\u2019s form, or overall structure, is often depicted via a series of capital letters, with each different letter representing a large section of contrasting material. Basic forms include <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">binary form</span></b> (\u201cAB\u201d or \u201cAABB\u201d), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ternary form</span></b> (\u201cABA\u201d), and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">strophic form</span></b> (\u201cA\u201d endlessly repeated, commonly found in folk songs or religious hymns with multiple verses).

Schubert wrote over 600 <i class=\"ygk-term\">lieder</i>, or German art songs. These lieder include works notable on their own, such as his Op.\u00a01 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cDie Erlk\u00f6nig\u201d</span></b>; the two song cycles <i class=\"ygk-term\">Die sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">Winterreise</i>; and lieder which he used as the basis for theme and variations movements in other namesake works, such as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cTrout\u201d Quintet</span></b> (for piano and string quartet, based on his lied \u201cThe Trout,\u201d or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cDie Forelle\u201d</span></b>). Schubert\u2019s orchestral output included numerous symphonies, the most well-known of which are No.\u00a08 in B\u00a0minor, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cUnfinished\u201d</span></b> (so named because Schubert only ever completed two movements), and No.\u00a09 in C\u00a0major, known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cGreat C\u00a0Major\u201d</span></b> (in part to distinguish it from No.\u00a06, the \u201cLittle C\u00a0Major\u201d).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Hector Berlioz</span></b> (1803\u20131869) was the most prominent French composer of the early Romantic. His best-known work, the programmatic <i class=\"ygk-term\">Symphonie fantastique</i> (subtitled \u201cAn Episode in the Life of an Artist\u201d), was inspired by his obsession with the actress <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Harriet Smithson</span></b>, whom Berlioz would later marry (and divorce). The work, whose movements include vivid depictions of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cMarch to the Scaffold\u201d</span></b> and a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cDream of a Witches\u2019 Sabbath,\u201d</span></b> uses a recurring melody known as an <i class=\"ygk-term\">id\u00e9e fixe</i>.

When Mendelssohn was 17 years old, he wrote a concert overture inspired by Shakespeare\u2019s play <i class=\"ygk-term\">A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream</i>; many years later, he wrote a complete set of incidental music for the play, including his famous <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cWedding March.\u201d</span></b> Mendelssohn\u2019s non-orchestral music includes eight books of <i class=\"ygk-term\">Songs Without Words</i> for solo piano.</li>",

The massive final movement, whose internal form closely resembles that of the entire symphony, utilizes both <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Friedrich Schiller</span></b>\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cOde to Joy\u201d</span></b> and original texts by Beethoven himself.

The symphony\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">five movements</span></b>, rather than the traditional four, each include a short title or description of their content: \u201cAwakening of cheerful feelings upon arrival in the country\u201d\u00a0(I), \u201cScene at the brook\u201d\u00a0(II), \u201cHappy gathering of country folks\u201d\u00a0(III),  \u201cThunderstorm\u201d\u00a0(IV), and \u201cHappy and thankful feelings after the storm\u201d&amp;nbsp(V). In the score for the second movement, Beethoven explicitly identifies several woodwind motifs as being based on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bird calls</span></b>.\n\t</li>",

The second movement is a solemn, C\u00a0minor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">funeral march</span></b>, while the finale is a playful set of variations on a melody Beethoven used in several other works. The composer originally intended to title the symphony <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBonaparte\u201d;</span></b> in a popular but possibly apocryphal story, Beethoven ripped the title page from the score upon hearing that Napoleon had declared himself emperor.\n\t</li>",

The libretto is by Joseph Sonnleithner, with revisions by Stephan von\u00a0Breuning and Georg Treitschke. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Leonore</span></b> wishes to rescure her husband <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Florestan</span></b> from the prison of the evil <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pizarro</span></b>; to do so, she <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">disguises herself</span></b> as a boy named Fidelio so that the jailer <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rocco</span></b> will hire her to help him, and thus grant her access to her husband. Beethoven struggled with his opera: he first presented it as a three-act work before cutting it to the present two-act form, and wrote <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">four separate overtures</span></b>. The opera utilizes some spoken (rather than sung) dialogue, and includes <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cO what joy,\u201d</span></b> a chorus sung by prisoners.\n\t</li>",

Although it uses the traditional text, Beethoven intended the work for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">concert performance</span></b> rather than liturgical use. Beethoven became increasingly fascinated by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fugue</span></b> during his third stylistic period; his Missa solemnis includes two immense examples that conclude the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Gloria</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Credo movements</span></b>. The composer dedicated the work to his patron, the Austrian Archduke <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rudolf</span></b>. The Missa solemnis should not be confused with Beethoven\u2019s earlier C\u00a0major mass, op.\u00a086 (1807).\n\t</li>",

Beethoven defies traditional concerto structure in the opening movement by placing the most significant solo material for the piano at the beginning of the movement, rather than near its end. Beethoven did not give the work its title; it was first dubbed \u201cEmperor\u201d by Johann Cramer, who first published the work in England. The \u201cEmperor,\u201d which was premiered by pianist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Friedrich Schneider</span></b>, is the only one of Beethoven\u2019s piano concertos that the composer himself never performed publicly.\n\t</li>",

Beethoven\u2019s score calls for the sustain pedal to be held down through the entirety of the first movement. Often overshadowed by the ubiquitous first movement is the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">violent third movement</span></b>, a <i>Presto agitato</i> sonata-allegro form with an extended coda, which on a larger scale serves as a recapitulation for the entire sonata. Beethoven dedicated the sonata to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Giulietta Guicciardi</span></b>, his pupil.\n\t</li>",

The sonata begins ominously: a theme descends in open octaves to the lowest note of the contemporary piano before rising again in an arpeggio, immediately repeated a\u00a0minor second higher. The second movement has no stable conclusion, instead directly leading to the third through the use of a diminished seventh chord. The final movement\u2019s coda, which itself introduces new thematic material, is one of the most demanding and difficult passages in all of the composer\u2019s repertoire.\n\t</li>",

That sonata begins with a theme and variations that inspired <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Reger\">Max Reger</a> to write his <i>Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Mozart</i>. Sonata No.\u00a014 in C\u00a0minor, K.\u00a0457, is often performed with the highly chromatic Fantasy, K.\u00a0475. Other notable Mozart piano sonatas include the dramatic No.\u00a08 in A\u00a0minor, K.\u00a0310; the Sonata <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cfor beginners\u201d</span></b> No.\u00a016 in C\u00a0major, K.\u00a0545; and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cHunt\u201d</span></b> or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cTrumpet\u201d</span></b> Sonata No.\u00a018 in D, K.\u00a0576, his last. Mozart also finished four sonatas for piano duet (also known as \u201cpiano four hands\u201d) and one in D\u00a0major for two pianos.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Piano Concertos</span></b>: Mozart\u2019s piano concertos are numbered from 1\u201327, though six of them are arrangements of works by other composers. The Concerto No.\u00a08 in C\u00a0major, K.\u00a0246, is named for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Countess L\u00fctzow</span></b>, for whom it was written, and No.\u00a09 in E\u00a0flat\u00a0major, K.\u00a0271, is nicknamed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cJeunehomme\u201d</span></b> (although recent scholarship suggests the title should actually be \u201cJenamy,\u201d after an acquaintance of Mozart named Victoire Jenamy). The first movement of the <i>Jeunehomme\u201d Concerto</i> unusually (for the time) has the soloist start playing very early\u2014in the second measure\u2014and its last movement Rondo includes a slow minuet section. The Concerto No.\u00a021 in C, K.\u00a0467, is often nicknamed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cElvira Madigan\u201d</span></b> because it was used in the 1967 <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061620/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\">Swedish film</a> of that name. No.\u00a026 in D, K.\u00a0537, is called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cCoronation,\u201d</span></b> because it was played at the coronation of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor\">Leopold\u00a0II</a>. Mozart also wrote concertos for two pianos (No.\u00a010 in E\u00a0flat\u00a0major, K.\u00a0365) and three pianos (No.\u00a07 in F\u00a0major, K.\u00a0242, nicknamed \u201cLodron\u201d).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">String Quartets</span></b>: Mozart, like most composers of his day, wrote most of his quartets in sets of three or six; he also wrote two standalone quartets for a total of 23. The most famous are probably the six <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Haydn\">\u201cHaydn\u201d Quartets</a> (Nos.\u00a014\u201319).

The <i class=\"ygk-term\">Haydn Quartets</i> also include the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Hunt Quartet</i>, No.\u00a017 in B\u00a0flat\u00a0major, K.\u00a0458, so named for its \u201chunting-horn\u201d melodies. The other famous collection of Mozart quartets is the set of three <i class=\"ygk-term\">Prussian Quartets</i> (Nos.\u00a021\u201323), dedicated to <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_William_II_of_Prussia\">Friedrich Wilhelm II</a>, which make prominent use of the cello.

Of the three, only No.\u00a039 in E\u00a0flat\u00a0major, K.\u00a0543, has a slow introduction;  unusually, it omits oboes entirely.  No.\u00a040 in G\u00a0minor, K.\u00a0550, on the other hand, was revised to reduce the oboe part and add clarinets; the last movement may have inspired the third movement of Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony.  No.\u00a041 in C\u00a0major, K.\u00a0551, probably got its nickname of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cJupiter\u201d</span></b> from Johann Peter Salomon. Its first movement quotes Mozart\u2019s aria <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cUn bacio di mano\u201d</span></b> (\u201cA kiss on her hand\u201d), composed for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pasquale Anfossi</span></b>\u2019s opera <i>Il curioso indiscreto</i>; its last movement presents five themes which are all brought together in a massive <i class=\"ygk-term\">fugato</i> at the end.</li>",

The theme of the \u201cKyrie\u201d was taken from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cAnd With His Stripes We Are Healed,\u201d</span></b> a chorus from Handel\u2019s <i>Messiah</i>. After the dramatic \u201cDies Irae,\u201d the \u201cTuba Mirum\u201d begins with a trombone solo. The circumstances surrounding Mozart\u2019s death remain mysterious, and the (unfounded) rumor that Antonio Salieri murdered him gave rise to the Aleksandr Pushkin play <i>Mozart and Salieri</i>, which in turn inspired a Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov opera and Peter Shaffer\u2019s <i>Amadeus</i>, which became an Academy Award-winning <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086879/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\">film</a>.</li>"
