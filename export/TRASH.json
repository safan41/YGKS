Because of differences between the Gregorian and Jewish calendar, Rosh HaShanah may fall anywhere between September\u00a05 and October\u00a05. Rosh HaShanah services often include 100 soundings of the <i class=\"ygk-term\">shofar</i>, or ram\u2019s horn, and in many communities people may gather by bodies of water to perform the ritual of <i class=\"ygk-term\">tashlikh</i>, or the casting off of sins (represented by breadcrumbs or the like) into water. A popular treat on Rosh HaShanah is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">apples dipped in honey</span></b>, symbolizing hopes for a sweet and pleasant year. There are actually several other notions of the new year in Judaism; most notably, Nissan is often considered the first month because that is the month in which the exodus from Egypt took place, and the holiday Tu\u00a0B\u2019Sh\u2019vat is considered the new year for trees.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Chinese New Year</span></b> is a lengthy celebration of the incoming year that traditionally lasts for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">15 days</span></b>. The Chinese calendar is a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">lunar calendar</span></b>, and the first day of the first month falls on the first new moon of late January or early February. It is traditional in China for people to travel home to their families to celebrate the new year; this period of travel, known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chunyun</span></b>, involves nearly 400\u00a0million people. On the New Year, children are often given <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">red envelopes containing money</span></b> by their older, married relatives; one folk origin of this tradition involves the glimmer of coins scaring away a demon. Chinese New Year celebrations conclude on the 15th day of the year with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lantern Festival</span></b>, in which (usually red) paper lanterns with riddles written on the side are lit.</li>",

Traditional preparations for Nowruz include gathering <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">water</span></b> to fill all available vessels in a household, as a sign of abundance. Among the best known of Nowruz traditions is the Haft Sin, a table setting of seven dishes\u2014including sprouts, apples, and olives\u2014each of which begins with the same letter in Persian.

T\u1ebft, like the Chinese New Year, has a moveable date in the Gregorian calendar, as it is based on the observation of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">new moon</span></b>. The first three days of T\u1ebft involve traditions of visitation: it is a widely held belief that the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">first visitor</span></b> to a house in the new year will determine a family\u2019s luck for the remainder of the year, so a family will selectively invite their ritual first guest of the year to ensure good fortune. On the second and third days of T\u1ebft, people traditionally visit <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">friends and teachers</span></b>, respectively. Traditional foods for T\u1ebft include <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">b\u00e1nh chung</span></b>, a rice cake legendarily invented by a Hung prince to win the throne.

The origin of the name \u201cHogmanay\u201d is unclear, though it may derive from \u201choginane,\u201d a French word meaning \u201cgala day.\u201d Hogmanay traditions include the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ringing of bells</span></b> to ring in the new year, and the collective singing of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d</span></b>\u2014a tradition that spread to many other Western cultures.

In 1873 Japan switched from a lunar calendar to the Gregorian calendar following the Meiji Restoration and began to observe New Year festivities on January\u00a01.

Foods eaten on New Years include pounded rice cakes known as <i class=\"ygk-term\">mochi</i> and a chicken soup called <i class=\"ygk-term\">ozouni</i>. The \u201cLittle New Year\u201d on January\u00a015 may involve the taking down of New Year\u2019s decorations, fire festivals, and preparation of a gruel made with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">azuki beans and rice</span></b>.</li>",

Songkran is celebrated from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">April\u00a013 to 15</span></b> and coincides with the astrological progression into Aries. Songkran celebrations usually include a ritual ceremony at the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Wat Pho Temple</span></b> in Bangkok, which is home to a massive <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">reclining Buddha</span></b> statue. The festival gets its popular name from the tradition of people <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sprinkling and splashing water</span></b> on each other to wash away the past year, which developed into large festive water fights, in part to relieve the April heat (though these have been more tightly regulated in recent years). Many other Southeast Asian nations celebrate a water festival at the same time as Songkran, including Myanmar (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thingyan</span></b>), Laos (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pi Mai</span></b>), and Cambodia (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chaul Chnam Thmey</span></b>).</li>",

The main Junkanoo parade is a massive procession down <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bay Street</span></b> in Nassau. In the procession, groups that may number in the hundreds perform traditional <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">folk music and dance</span></b> while dressed in elaborate costumes; the performing groups in the parade compete with one another for prizes. Junkanoo parades are known for beginning in the middle of the night, with many of them starting at around <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">2 to 3\u00a0a.m.</span></b> and continuing until nearly noon.</li>",

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">London, 1851: Great Exhibition\u201d</span></b> The Great Exhibition was the first ever \u201cWorld\u2019s Fair.\u201d The event was largely organized by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Prince Albert</span></b> and was held in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cCrystal Palace,\u201d</span></b> a structure nearly three times larger than St.\u00a0Paul\u2019s Cathedral. Exhibitors included <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Samuel Colt</span></b>, who brought a prototype of his \u201cNavy\u201d pistol, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mathew Brady</span></b>, a pioneer of daguerreotypes. A boating race held in conjunction with the exhibition was won by a ship called <i>America</i>, leading to its prize becoming known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">America\u2019s Cup</span></b>. It also featured the world\u2019s first modern <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pay toilets</span></b>, which cost a penny to use. The Crystal Palace remained in use for decades after the event was over, but was destroyed by a fire in 1936.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Paris, 1889: Exposition Universelle</span></b> Although Paris had hosted the World\u2019s Fair three times before, its 1889 event was easily its most iconic. It is best known for its centerpiece, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eiffel Tower</span></b>, which was by far the tallest structure in the world when it was completed. Exhibits were placed throughout the Champ de Mars, including the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cStreets of Cairo,\u201d</span></b> an elaborate interpretation of Egypt\u2019s capital. Another of its most popular attractions was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201chuman zoo,\u201d</span></b> in which various indigenous and other non-white people were put on display, a practice that was largely accepted at the time. The Eiffel Tower was scheduled to be dismantled 20 years after the 1889 fair, but its usefulness in telegraphy led to those plans being scrapped.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Chicago, 1893: World\u2019s Columbian Exposition</span></b> Chicago\u2019s 1893 fair was nicknamed the \u201cColumbian Exposition\u201d to honor the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus\u2019s voyages to the \u201cNew World.\u201d A massive pool representing Columbus\u2019s voyage served as its centerpiece. Other debuts at the fair included the first <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ferris Wheel</span></b>, the first chocolate <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">brownies</span></b>, and the first <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201csquished penny\u201d souvenirs</span></b>. The event is also associated with multiple controversies. Chicago mayor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Carter Harrison</span></b> was assassinated during its final days, leading to the cancellation of the closing ceremony. Additionally, serial killer <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">H.\u00a0H. Holmes</span></b> and his so-called \u201cMurder Castle\u201d are often tied to the fair, though their actual connection is likely minimal. Both the fair and the associated crimes are detailed in Erik Larson\u2019s book <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Devil in the White City</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">St.\u00a0Louis, 1904: Louisiana Purchase Exposition</span></b> The 1904 World\u2019s Fair was held to honor the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase. It saw the debut of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">X-ray machine</span></b> and inspired the popular song <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cMeet Me in St.\u00a0Louis, Louis.\u201d</span></b> The fair featured daily re-enactments of battles from the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Second Boer War</span></b>, many of which featured people who had actually fought in it. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">1904 Summer Olympics</span></b> had been awarded to Chicago but were re-located to St.\u00a0Louis so they could be held alongside the fair. That change led to very sparse attendance and poorly run events over the course of several months. Novelist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kate Chopin</span></b> suffered a brain hemorrhage while visiting the 1904 fair and died two days later.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Brussels, 1958</span></b> The first full-scale world\u2019s fair after World War\u00a0II was held in Brussels in 1958. A lasting symbol of the Brussels fair is the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Atomium</span></b>, a 335-foot model of a unit cell of an iron crystal. The structure, which remains among the city\u2019s most popular attractions, is approximately 165 billion times larger than the cell it represents. The fair also featured the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Po\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique</i>, a piece of electronic music by Edgard Var\u00e8se played in a specialized pavilion designed by Le\u00a0Corbusier. The first universal poll to rank the greatest films was held at the Brussels fair, which was topped by Sergei Eisenstein\u2019s <i>Battleship Potemkin</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Seattle, 1962: Century 21</span></b> Because of the ongoing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">space race</span></b>, Seattle\u2019s fair had a strong focus on technology and aerospace. Structures built for the fair include the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Space Needle</span></b> and a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">monorail</span></b>, both of which are still standing today. Its \u201cWorld of Science\u201d building housed the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Project Mercury capsule</span></b> that took Alan Shepard to space, and its \u201cWorld of Century 21\u201d building offered glimpses of \u201cthe future\u201d of cities, cars, and air travel. John F. Kennedy intended to attend the closing of the fair, but was unable to because of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The fairgrounds, now known as the Seattle Center, has since become home to the Museum of Pop Culture.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">New York, 1964</span></b> Like the Seattle fair two years earlier, the New York fair was themed around the burgeoning <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Space Age</span></b>, particularly with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Unisphere</span></b>, a massive stainless-steel globe that served as a key symbol of the event. Pope John\u00a0XXIII allowed Michelangelo\u2019s <i>Piet\u00e0</i> to be relocated to the fair\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Vatican Pavilion</span></b>. Elsewhere, Walt Disney designed several animatronic attractions for the fair, including his first incarnation of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cIt\u2019s a Small World\u201d</span></b> ride. While it is generally named for 1964, the fair had a second \u201cseason\u201d the following year as well. A pair of observation towers left over from the fair provide a key plot point to the movie <i>Men in Black</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Montreal, 1967: Expo 67</span></b> Montreal hosted one of the biggest world fairs in history and attracted over half a million visitors just days after opening. One highlight of the fair was the unveiling of Moshe Safdie\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cHabitat 67,\u201d</span></b> a complex of hundreds of interlocking concrete buildings intended as a model community. The U.S. Pavilion at the fair was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">geodesic dome</span></b> designed by Buckminster Fuller, which was later converted into a museum called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Biosphere</span></b>. In a notorious moment, French president Charles de\u00a0Gaulle addressed a crowd in Montreal and declared <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cLong live a free Quebec!,\u201d</span></b> angering many Canadian politicians.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Knoxville, 1982</span></b> In contrast to larger \u201cWorld Expos,\u201d Knoxville held a \u201cspecialized\u201d fair focused on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">energy</span></b>. Structures built for the event include the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sunsphere</span></b>, a 266-foot tower topped with a golden sphere. The fair also featured the debut of an early version of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">touch screen</span></b> and the introduction of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cherry Coke</span></b>. American sports were also featured during the event, with the NFL and NBA both hosting exhibition games at local venues. A fictional version of the Sunsphere had a prominent role in an episode of <i>The Simpsons</i>, in which it was converted into the \u201cWigsphere,\u201d a shop for discount wigs.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Dubai, 2020</span></b> The most recent world fair was scheduled for Dubai in 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it ultimately began in September 2021. The U.S. built a 36,000-square-foot pavilion for the fair, which featured artifacts like <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thomas Jefferson\u2019s copy of the Qur\u2019an</span></b> and a moon rock from the Apollo\u00a017 mission. The fair also played host to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">2021 World Chess Championship</span></b>, which was won by defending champion Magnus Carlsen. Shortly before the fair began, the European Parliament formally <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">opposed</span></b> the event, citing the UAE\u2019s human rights record, though it had little effect on attendance.</li>"

His film <i class=\"ygk-term\">Breathless</i> featured a then-unconventional use of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">jump cuts</span></b>, in which footage is removed from the middle of a continuous shot to communicate the passage of time. The film features <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jean-Paul Belmondo</span></b> as Michel, a criminal styling himself after Humphrey Bogart who is sheltered while on the run from the police by Patricia, played by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jean Seberg</span></b>.

The film is about the juvenile delinquent <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Antoine Doinel</span></b>, an alter-ego of sorts of Truffaut, who runs away from home and school, is arrested for stealing a typewriter from his stepfather, and escapes a juvenile detention center in order to see the ocean.

In the influential French film magazine <i class=\"ygk-term\">Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma</i>, Truffaut articulated what became known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">auteur theory</span></b>, which likens the film director to an \u201cauthor\u201d who shapes every aspect of a film according to a personal vision. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jeanne Moreau</span></b> starred as the woman at the center of a tragic love triangle in Truffaut\u2019s film <i class=\"ygk-term\">Jules and Jim</i> (1962).

Somehow this did not undermine his defense, as Stengel\u2019s Yankees led the league in double plays six times.  Remembered as a player for his two game-winning home runs, one an inside-the-parker, against the Yankees in the 1923 World Series, off the field his <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">vaudevillian personality</span></b> involved him in many famous incidents. When in 1958 he was called in front of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust and Monopoly</span></b> to testify on why baseball should be exempt from antitrust regulation, he testified with an hour\u2019s worth of classic \u201cStengelese.\u201d  When the baffled politicians let Stengel go and called on Mickey Mantle to answer their questions, he replied, \u201cMy views are about the same as Casey\u2019s.\u201d</li>",

While he was a dominant closer for his entire career, recording a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">record 652 saves</span></b> and managing an incredible <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">2.21 career ERA</span></b>, he was even more dominant in the playoffs, where his ERA was a mere 0.70. He was the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">first person to be unanimously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame</span></b>, reaching Cooperstown in 2019. He was also the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">final player in MLB history to wear the number 42</span></b>, which was retired league-wide to honor Jackie Robinson; players who wore the number at the time were permitted to continue wearing it, and Rivera was the last such player to retire.</li>"
