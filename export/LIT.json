                "<li><i class=\"label\">Our Town</i> (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thornton Wilder</span></b>, 1938).  A sentimental story that takes place in the village of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Grover\u2019s Corners, New Hampshire</span></b> just after the turn of the 20th century, <i>Our Town</i> is divided into three acts:  \u201cDaily Life\u201d (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Professor Willard</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Editor Webb</span></b> gossip on the everyday lives of town residents); \u201cLove and Marriage\u201d (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emily Webb</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George Gibbs</span></b> fall in love and marry); and \u201cDeath\u201d (Emily dies while giving birth, and her spirit converses about the meaning of life with other dead people in the cemetery).  A <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stage Manager</span></b> talks to the audience and serves as a narrator throughout the drama, which is performed on a bare stage.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night</i> (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eugene O\u2019Neill</span></b>, 1956).  O\u2019Neill wrote it fifteen years earlier and presented the manuscript to his third wife with instructions that it not be produced until 25\u00a0years after his death.  Actually produced three years after he died, it centers on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Edmund</span></b> and the rest of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tyrone family</span></b>, but is really an autobiographical account of the dysfunction of O\u2019Neill\u2019s own family, set on one day in August 1912.  The father is a miserly actor, while the mother is a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">morphine</span></b> addict, and the brother is a drunk; they argue and cut each other down throughout the play.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</i> (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Edward Albee</span></b>, 1962).  The author Virginia Woolf has little to do with the story, except that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Martha</span></b> sings the title to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George</span></b> when she is mad at him in Act\u00a0I.  In fact, Albee got the title from graffiti he saw on a men\u2019s room wall.  In the drama, George is a professor who married Martha, the college president\u2019s daughter, but the two dislike each other.  Martha invites another couple, the instructor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nick</span></b> and his wife <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Honey</span></b>, for drinks after a party for her father.  All four of them get drunk, and they end up bickering over their flawed marriages:  Besides George and Martha\u2019s problems, Honey is barren, and Nick married her for her money.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">A Streetcar Named Desire</i> (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tennessee Williams</span></b>, 1947).  <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Blanche DuBois</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stanley Kowalski</span></b> represent Williams\u2019s two visions of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">South</span></b>:  declining \u201cold romantic\u201d vs. the harsh modern era.  Blanche is a Southern belle who lost the family estate, and is forced to move into her sister <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stella</span></b>\u2019s New Orleans apartment.  Stella\u2019s husband <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stanley</span></b> is rough around the edges, but sees through Blanche\u2019s artifice; he ruins Blanche\u2019s chance to marry his friend <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mitch</span></b> by revealing to Mitch that Blanche was a prostitute.  Then, after Blanche confronts Stanley, he rapes her, driving her into insanity.  The drama was developed into a movie, marking the breakthrough performance of method actor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Marlon Brando</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">A Raisin in the Sun</i> (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lorraine Hansberry</span></b>, 1959).  Her father\u2019s 1940 court fight against <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">racist housing laws</span></b> provided the basis for Hansberry\u2019s play about the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Younger family</span></b>, who attempt to move into an all-white Chicago suburb but are confronted by discrimination.  The first play by an African-American woman to be performed on Broadway, it also tore down the racial stereotyping found in other works of the time.  The title comes from the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Langston Hughes</span></b> poem \"<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46548/harlem\">Harlem</a>\" (often called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cA Dream Deferred\u201d</span></b>).</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">The Crucible</i> (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Arthur Miller</span></b>, 1953).  Miller chose the 1692 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Salem witch trials</span></b> as his setting, but the work is really an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">allegorical</span></b> protest against the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">McCarthy anti-Communist \u201cwitch-hunts\u201d</span></b> of the early 1950s.  In the story, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Elizabeth Proctor</span></b> fires the servant <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Abigail Williams</span></b> after she finds out Abigail had an affair with her husband.  In response, Abigail accuses Elizabeth of witchcraft.  She stands trial and is acquitted, but then another girl accuses her husband, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John</span></b>, and as he refuses to turn in others, he is killed, along with the old comic figure, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Giles Corey</span></b>.  Also notable:  <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Judge Hathorne</span></b> is a direct ancestor of the author <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nathaniel Hawthorne</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Death of a Salesman</i> (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Arthur Miller</span></b>, 1949).  This play questions American values of success.  <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Willy Loman</span></b> is a failed salesman whose firm fires him after 34 years.  Despite his own failures, he desperately wants his sons <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Biff</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Happy</span></b> to succeed.

Once the women have gathered, Lysistrata reveals her proposal: all Greek women should abstain from having sex until the men agree to stop fighting.  Although Lysistrata\u2019s plan draws protests from her bawdy neighbor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Calonice</span></b>, and from the amorous wife <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Myrrhine</span></b>, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Spartan</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lampito</span></b> reluctantly supports the idea, and helps to convince the other women.

After a mysterious <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">plague</span></b> devastates Thebes, Oedipus sends his brother-in-law <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Creon</span></b> to ask the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Oracle at Delphi</span></b> about the cause of the affliction. The Oracle attributes the plague to the fact that the murderer of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Laius</span></b>, the previous king of Thebes, has never been caught and punished. Oedipus then seeks information from the prophet <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Teiresias</span></b>, who is provoked into revealing that Oedipus himself was the killer. Oedipus initially rejects this claim, but begins to have doubts after talking with his wife <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jocasta</span></b>, who was once married to Laius. Jocasta recalls a prophecy that Laius would be killed by his own son, but she claims that this prophecy did not come true, because Laius was murdered by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">highwaymen</span></b>. This leads Oedipus to recall killing a man who resembled Laius, and a prophecy which had claimed that Oedipus would kill his own father, and marry his own mother. A <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">shepherd</span></b> from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mount Cithaeron</span></b> reveals the awful truth: in response to the prophecy about their son, Laius and Jocasta had tried to expose the infant Oedipus in the wilderness. However, the shepherd had taken pity on the child, and sent him away to be raised in another area. Not knowing his true heritage, Oedipus eventually left home to avoid harming the people whom he believed to be his parents, but unknowingly fulfilled the prophecy by killing Laius and marrying Jocasta. Upon learning this, Jocasta commits suicide, and Oedipus <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">blinds</span></b> himself with Jocasta\u2019s brooches.

The tragedy takes place in the immediate aftermath of a battle in which Oedipus\u2019s two sons, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Polyneices</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eteocles</span></b>, killed each other while struggling to control <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thebes</span></b>. The current ruler of the city, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Creon</span></b>, has declared that Eteocles will be given an honorable funeral, but Polyneices will be treated as a rebel and left unburied. Oedipus\u2019s daughter <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Antigone</span></b> disobeys Creon\u2019s order, and buries her brother Polyneices against the advice of her frightened sister, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ismene</span></b>. Despite the intervention of Creon\u2019s son <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Haemon</span></b>, who is betrothed to Antigone, Creon sentences Antigone to be entombed alive. Soon after she is imprisoned, Antigone hangs herself. Haemon then commits suicide out of grief, and Creon\u2019s wife <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eurydice</span></b> kills herself when she learns that Haemon is dead. The once-proud Creon blames himself for the loss of his wife and son, and prays for death.</li>",

Most of the play consists of a conversation between Eteocles, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">chorus</span></b>, and a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">spy</span></b> who describes the seven <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">captains</span></b> who have arrived to besiege the seven gates of Thebes.  After each man is described, Eteocles selects the warrior who will face that attacker. When the seventh attacker is revealed to be Polyneices, Eteocles sets off to confront his brother. At the conclusion of the play, it is announced that although Eteocles\u2019s forces have turned back the invaders, the brothers have slain each other. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Antigone</span></b>, the sister of Eteocles and Polyneices, vows to defy the laws of Thebes by giving Polyneices a proper burial.</li>",

Set after the Argonauts\u2019 quest, the play depicts Medea\u2019s vengeance against Jason as he prepares to marry the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Corinthian</span></b> princess <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Glauce</span></b>.  Medea uses <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">poisoned robes</span></b> to kill Glauce and Glauce\u2019s father <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Creon</span></b> (a different character than the Creon who appears in Sophocles\u2019s Theban plays).  Not content with this, Medea seeks to hurt Jason further by killing the sons that she bore him. When Jason tries to confront Medea, she appears above the stage in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">chariot</span></b> pulled by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dragons</span></b>, and exchanges bitter words with her former lover before departing to seek refuge with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">King Aegeus</span></b> of Athens. The play\u2019s ending is a classic example of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">deus ex\u00a0machina</span></b>, a literary device in which plot problems are suddenly resolved by an unexpected contrivance.</li>",

The god first drives the women of the city mad, causing them to act as wild <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Maenads</span></b>.  He then convinces Pentheus to disguise himself in animal skins, and spy on the maddened women.  However, the demented Agave mistakes Pentheus for a mountain lion, and dismembers her own son.  The climax of the play occurs when Agave presents the head of Pentheus to her horrified father, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cadmus</span></b>. As Agave realizes what she has done, Dionysus chastises her for her lack of respect, and foretells how Cadmus will spend his final days.</li>",

As the daughter of the philosophers <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">William Godwin</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mary Wollstonecraft</span></b> (the author of <i class=\"ygk-term\">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>), and the wife of the poet <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Percy Bysshe Shelley</span></b>, Mary Shelley was a product of both the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Enlightenment</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Romantic eras</span></b>. Her 1818 novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus</i> helped to lay the groundwork for modern science fiction by contrasting Enlightenment ideas of progress with a Romantic conception of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">nature as an untameable force</span></b>. The idea for <i>Frankenstein</i> came to Shelley while she was taking part in a friendly writing competition at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lord Byron</span></b>\u2019s villa on Lake Geneva. Inspired by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Luigi Galvani</span></b>\u2019s experiments in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201canimal electricity,\u201d</span></b> Shelley wrote about the Swiss scientist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Victor Frankenstein</span></b>, who reanimates dead tissue and creates a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cmonster.\u201d</span></b> This attempt to control nature fails, as the monster <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">murders Frankenstein\u2019s brother William</span></b>, friend <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Henry Clerval</span></b>, and wife <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Elizabeth</span></b> before fleeing to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Arctic</span></b>. Frankenstein pursues his creation, and tells his story to the explorer <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert Walton</span></b> before dying. Shelley presented an even bleaker scenario in her 1826 novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Last Man</i>, which describes <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lionel Verney</span></b>\u2019s efforts to survive a 21st-century plague that devastates human civilization.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Jules Verne</span></b> (1828\u20131905, France). Verne offered a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">brighter vision of technological progress</span></b> in his novels of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">adventure</span></b>, many of which doubled as works of popular science. In Verne\u2019s 1864 novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Journey to the Center of the Earth</i>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Professor Lidenbrock</span></b> explains contemporary theories of geology and paleontology as he leads an expedition that travels beneath the Earth\u2019s crust from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Iceland</span></b> to the Italian volcano <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stromboli</span></b>. Verne later wrote the 1870 novel  <i class=\"ygk-term\">Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</i>, whose narrator <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pierre Aronnax</span></b> offers extensive commentary on marine biology while accompanying the mysterious <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Captain Nemo</span></b> on a voyage in the submarine <i class=\"ygk-term\">Nautilus</i>. In a more realistic vein, Verne considered the possibilities presented by new forms of transportation in the 1873 novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Around the World in Eighty Days</i>, which describes a trip taken by the Englishman <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Phileas Fogg</span></b> and his French valet <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jean Passepartout</span></b>. During his travels, which are undertaken to win a bet with members of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Reform Club</span></b>, Fogg falls in love with an Indian woman named <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aouda</span></b>, and is pursued by the Scotland Yard detective <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Fix</span></b>, who mistakenly believes that Fogg is a bank robber.

In the 1895 novella <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Time Machine</i>, Wells wrote about a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cTime Traveller\u201d</span></b> who visits the year <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">AD\u00a0802,701</span></b>, and learns that humanity has diverged into two different species\u2014the surface-dwelling <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eloi</span></b>, who are gentle and beautiful but intellectually limited, and the subterranean <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Morlocks</span></b>, who resemble apes but are strong and clever enough to use the Eloi as livestock. The Time Traveller speculates that the Eloi are descended from aristocrats who were once served by the ancestors of the Morlocks. After writing about time travel, Wells helped to establish another of science fiction\u2019s key themes by depicting an alien invasion in the 1897 novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">The War of the Worlds</i>. The anonymous narrator of <i>The War of the Worlds</i> observes a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Martian spaceship</span></b> that lands in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Surrey</span></b>, and flees the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cTripods\u201d</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBlack Smoke\u201d</span></b> that the Martians use as weapons in the conquest of Earth. The invaders easily overcome human resistance, but eventually perish from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">lack of immunity</span></b> to Earth microbes. Wells also wrote several novels about researchers who use science to pursue unethical goals. In the 1896 Wells novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Island of Dr.\u00a0Moreau</i>, the shipwrecked <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Edward Prendick</span></b> discovers that the title vivisectionist performs painful experiments to transform animals into human-like <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBeast Folk.\u201d</span></b> A year later Wells published <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Invisible Man</i>, which centers on a student of physics named <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Griffin</span></b> who plans to use his invisibility to enact a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201creign of terror.\u201d</span></b> However, Griffin\u2019s invisibility makes it difficult for him to exist in society (he must cover himself with clothes and thick bandages if he wishes to be seen), and he is eventually killed by an angry crowd.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Aldous Huxley</span></b> (1894\u20131963, United Kingdom). Aldous Huxley belonged to a prominent family of British intellectuals that included the Victorian <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">evolutionist</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thomas Henry Huxley</span></b>. Although Aldous Huxley depicted his own social milieu in novels such as <i class=\"ygk-term\">Crome Yellow</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">Point Counter Point</i>, he is best known for writing about a dystopian <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cWorld State\u201d</span></b> in the 1932 novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Brave New World</i>.  Extrapolating from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Henry Ford</span></b>\u2019s model of industrial production and contemporary advances in biochemistry, Huxley imagined a world in which the fictional <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBokanovsky\u2019s Process\u201d</span></b> is used to create human clones, which are then modified to posses different intellectual abilities, and sorted into social <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">castes</span></b> named after the Greek letters <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Alpha</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Beta</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Gamma</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Delta</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Epsilon</span></b>. Inhabitants of the World State enjoy a prosperous existence, immersive entertainment known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Feelies</span></b>, and the drug <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">soma</span></b>, but lack family connections and spiritual fulfillment. The shallow pleasures of the World State are contrasted with the ideals of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John the Savage</span></b>, a young man who grew up on a New Mexico reservation. John is initially delighted to meet the World State residents <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bernard Marx</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lenina Crowne</span></b>, and excitedly quotes the \u201cBrave New World\u201d speech from Shakespeare\u2019s play <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Tempest</i>. However, John soon grows disgusted with \u201ccivilization.\u201d After the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">World Controller Mustapha Mond</span></b> forbids John from living on an isolated island with the aspiring writer <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Helmholtz Watson</span></b>, John unsuccessfully tries to retreat from society, and eventually <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">hangs himself</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">George Orwell</span></b> (1903\u20131950, United Kingdom). George Orwell (the pen name of <b><span class=\"label\">Eric Arthur Blair</span></b>) condemned the totalitarian government of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joseph Stalin</span></b> in the fantasy <i class=\"ygk-term\">Animal Farm</i> and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dystopian novel</span></b> <i class=\"ygk-term\">Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>. Orwell\u2019s speculative fiction was part of a wide-ranging body of work that also included <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">attacks on British colonialism</span></b> (the essay \u201cShooting an Elephant\u201d and the novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Burmese Days</i>), first-hand <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">accounts of war</span></b> (<i class=\"ygk-term\">Homage to Catalonia</i>) and poverty (<i class=\"ygk-term\">Down and Out in Paris and London</i>, <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Road to Wigan Pier</i>), and works of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cultural criticism</span></b> (the essay \u201cPolitics and the English Language\u201d). After taking part in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Spanish Civil War</span></b> and growing alarmed at the authoritarian nature of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Russian communism</span></b>, Orwell wrote the 1945 novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Animal Farm</i> as an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">allegory</span></b> of the Russian Revolution and its aftermath. <i>Animal Farm</i> describes barnyard animals who revolt against their owner, and try to create a more equitable society under the leadership of the pig <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Snowball</span></b>, who develops principles of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cAnimalism\u201d</span></b> such as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cFour legs good, two legs bad.\u201d</span></b> However, Snowball is soon ousted by his fellow pig <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Napoleon</span></b>, who exploits the other animals, sends the horse <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Boxer</span></b> to be slaughtered, and degrades the principles of Animalism to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201call animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\u201d</span></b> Four years later, Orwell imagined a future Britain subsumed into <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Oceania</span></b>, a superpower under the harsh rule of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBig Brother\u201d</span></b>, in the novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Winston Smith</span></b> and his lover <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Julia</span></b> try to rebel against Big Brother, but are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tortured</span></b> into compliance in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ministry of Love</span></b>.  <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> also described the distortion of the English language for political purposes (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cNewspeak\u201d</span></b>), and introduced many words and phrases that are still used with reference to oppressive governments (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">thoughtcrime</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">doublethink</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">memory hole</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cwe\u2019ve always been at war with Eastasia,\u201d</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cwar is peace,\u201d</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBig Brother is watching you\u201d</span></b>).</li>",
                "<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Isaac Asimov</span></b> (1920\u20131992, United States). Along with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert A. Heinlein</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Arthur C. Clarke</span></b>, Asimov was one of genre science fiction\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBig Three\u201d</span></b> writers. During the 1930s\u2019 and 1940s\u2019 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cGolden Age\u201d of science fiction pulp magazines</span></b>, Asimov worked closely with <i class=\"ygk-term\">Astounding Science Fiction</i> editor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John W. Campbell Jr.</span></b> to create stories such as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cNightfall,\u201d</span></b> which describes a rare moment of darkness on a planet with multiple suns, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cRobbie,\u201d</span></b> the first of Asimov\u2019s many works about <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">robots</span></b> with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">positronic brains</span></b>. (The word \u201crobot\u201d was introduced by the Czech author <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Karel \u010capek</span></b> in the 1920 play <i class=\"ygk-term\">R.U.R.</i>, which depicts the worldwide uprising of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cRossum\u2019s Universal Robots\u201d</span></b>). Before Asimov, most stories about artificial life had followed the template established by Shelley\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Frankenstein</i>, in which a scientist who tries to usurp God\u2019s power to create life is ultimately destroyed by his own creation.  Asimov challenged this trope by creating the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cThree Laws of Robotics,\u201d</span></b> which robots in his stories are obligated to follow:\n\t\t<ol>\n<li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li>\n<li>A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li>\n<li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.</li>\n</ol>\n\t\tBy using these laws in dozens of stories (some of which were collected in the book <i class=\"ygk-term\">I, Robot</i>), Asimov helped to promote a conception of robots as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">useful machines</span></b> rather than inhuman monsters. Asimov is also known for his <i class=\"ygk-term\">Foundation</i> series, which was inspired by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Edward Gibbon</span></b>\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>. The <i class=\"ygk-term\">Foundation</i> series begins when the \u201cpsychohistorian\u201d <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hari Seldon</span></b> realizes that the Galactic Empire will soon fall, and creates the title organization to limit the length of the ensuing Dark Age. Asimov eventually linked together his <i class=\"ygk-term\">Robot</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">Foundation</i> series into a far-reaching \u201chistory of the future,\u201d which also includes Asimov\u2019s novels <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Caves of Steel</i>, <i class=\"ygk-term\">Pebble in the Sky</i>, and <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Stars, Like Dust</i>.\n\t</li>",

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Ray Bradbury</span></b> (1920\u20132012, United States). Bradbury\u2019s science fiction and fantasy stories often contain nostalgic elements related to his <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Midwestern childhood</span></b>. The Illinois community <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Green Town</span></b> is the setting of Bradbury\u2019s novels <i class=\"ygk-term\">Dandelion Wine</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>, both of which center on boys beginning to enter adulthood. Similarly, small towns on Earth and Mars are the setting of many stories in Bradbury\u2019s 1950 collection <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Martian Chronicles</i>, which is made up of loosely connected works about the expeditions of human <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">astronauts</span></b>, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">displacement of indigenous Martians</span></b> as human settlers arrive, and a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">nuclear war</span></b> that destroys most life on Earth.  Bradbury also wrote about Mars in several stories that appear in his collection <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Illustrated Man</i>, whose title character has <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tattoos</span></b> that foretell the future. Another theme that recurs in Bradbury\u2019s works is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">censorship</span></b> and the importance of literature. This theme is expressed most strongly in Bradbury\u2019s 1953 novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Fahrenheit 451</i>, which depicts a dystopian future in which <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cfiremen\u201d burn books</span></b>. The protagonist of <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Guy Montag</span></b>, a fireman whose wife <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mildred</span></b> is deeply depressed and addicted to television programs that she watches on large <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cparlor walls.\u201d</span></b> Montag begins to question his profession after meeting the free-spirited <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Clarisse McClellan</span></b>, and secretly preserves books to read, leading to a rebuke from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Fire Captain Beatty</span></b>.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Kurt Vonnegut</span></b> (1922\u20132007, United States). Vonnegut\u2019s fiction provides a darkly humorous response to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">absurdities and violence of the twentieth century</span></b>. During World War\u00a0II, Vonnegut was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">prisoner of war</span></b> in Germany, and lived through the Allied <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">firebombing of Dresden</span></b>. That experience was the basis for Vonnegut\u2019s novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, in which the soldier <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Billy Pilgrim</span></b> becomes <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cunstuck in time,\u201d</span></b> and perceives his life in a non-linear fashion. Billy travels between the present, past, and future as he is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">captured</span></b> by the German army, witnesses the destruction of Dresden, becomes a prosperous <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">optometrist</span></b> in the town of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ilium</span></b>, is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">kidnapped</span></b> by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">aliens</span></b> and placed in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">zoo</span></b> along with the actress <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Montana Wildhack</span></b>, and is eventually <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">assassinated</span></b>. <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> contains a number of elements that recur in other Vonnegut novels, including the veteran <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eliot Rosewater</span></b>, aliens from the planet <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tralfamadore</span></b>, the unsuccessful science fiction writer <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kilgore Trout</span></b>, and members of the wealthy <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rumfoord family</span></b>. Vonnegut also wrote the novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Cat\u2019s Cradle</i>, which describes a substance called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cice-nine\u201d</span></b> that instantly turns liquid water into a solid. Ice-nine was created by the atomic scientist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Felix Hoenikker</span></b>, whose life is researched by the novel\u2019s narrator, John. Another thread in <i>Cat\u2019s Cradle</i> concerns the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cbittersweet lies\u201d</span></b> of the prophet <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bokonon</span></b>, who lives on the Caribbean island <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">San Lorenzo</span></b>. Bokonon comments on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">human stupidity</span></b> after an accident that occurs during the funeral of the San Lorenzan dictator <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Papa Monzano</span></b> causes ice-nine to fall into the ocean, destroying almost all life on Earth.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Margaret Atwood</span></b> (1939\u2013present, Canada). One of Canada\u2019s most prominent authors of literary fiction, Atwood has written multiple works that combine speculative elements with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">psychological realism</span></b>. In 1985 Atwood published <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</i>, which portrays a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dystopian</span></b> near-future in which the United States has been replaced by the patriarchal <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Republic of Gilead</span></b>. <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</i> is narrated by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Offred</span></b>, whose role as a \u201chandmaid\u201d is to bear children for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cthe Commander\u201d</span></b> and his wife, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Serena Joy</span></b>. Offred flees her oppressive existence with the help of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nick</span></b>, a chauffeur who claims to be a member of the underground <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mayday</span></b> resistance movement. In an epilogue set in the year 2195, the archivist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Professor Pieixoto</span></b> discusses Offred\u2019s unknown fate. Atwood later wrote a trilogy set in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">post-apocalyptic</span></b> world where corporations have created <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bioengineered diseases</span></b> and people (<i class=\"ygk-term\">Oryx and Crake</i>, <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Year of the Flood</i>, and <i class=\"ygk-term\">MaddAddam</i>). In addition to her speculative works, Atwood has also written <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">historical fiction</span></b> (<i class=\"ygk-term\">Alias Grace</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Blind Assassin</i>, the latter of which contains a character who is a science fiction author), novels about the relationships between female friends (<i class=\"ygk-term\">Cat\u2019s Eye</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Robber Bride</i>), and a retelling of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Homer</span></b>\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Odyssey</span></b> from a female point of view (<i class=\"ygk-term\">The Penelopiad</i>).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Douglas Adams</span></b> (1952\u20132001, United Kingdom). Adams wrote <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">comic science fiction and fantasy novels</span></b> that poked fun at genre tropes and the quirks of British culture. After working on <i class=\"ygk-term\">Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus</i>, Adams created the BBC radio series <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy</i>, which premiered in 1978. The radio series became the basis of a series of novels (<i>The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy</i>; <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</i>; <i class=\"ygk-term\">Life, the Universe, and Everything</i>; <i class=\"ygk-term\">So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish</i>; <i class=\"ygk-term\">Mostly Harmless</i>; and the authorized sequel <i class=\"ygk-term\">And Another Thing\u2026</i>, which was written by <i class=\"ygk-term\">Artemis Fowl</i> author <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eoin Colfer</span></b> after Adams died).

                "<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Jezebel</span></b>, from 1\u00a0Kings\u00a016 (throughout)\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tNo one exact Biblical passage accounts for the modern usage of the term \u201cJezebel\u201d to mean a brazenly promiscuous and devious woman; this usage derives from interpretation of her story as a whole. Jezebel, a pagan, married King Ahab and used her influence as queen to diminish worship of Yahweh in Israel, threaten the prophet Elijah, and help Ahab kill a vineyard owner. For these actions, Elijah prophesied Ahab\u2019s death, as well as Jezebel\u2019s (namely, that she would be eaten by dogs). Jezebel\u2019s reputation as wanton seems to primarily derive from how, upon seeing Jehu (an enemy commander) marching on the palace, Jezebel put on make-up and jewelry to either taunt him, seduce him, or simply look regal. This was her final act; Jehu ordered eunuchs to push Jezebel from her window, where she fell into the street and had her flesh devoured by dogs.\r\n\t</li>",
                "<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Behemoth</span></b>, from Job\u00a040:15\u201318: \u201cLook at Behemoth, which I made along with you\u2026. What strength it has in its loins, what power in the muscles of its belly! \u2026 Its bones are tubes of bronze, its limbs like rods of iron.\u201d\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tDepending on translation, the monster Behemoth either was the first or the mightiest thing God created. Near the end of the Book of Job (which concerns a wager between God and Satan to see if God\u2019s most righteous believer, Job, will lose his faith if deprived of all pleasure and comfort), Job begins cursing God. God appears as a storm and asserts that He alone created order out of chaos and that Job knows nothing. At the end a long speech about His power, God shows Job both Behemoth and the monster Leviathan to prove his ultimate power and wisdom. Behemoth, thus, has come to mean any unbeatable foe or gigantic entity.\r\n\t</li>",
                "<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">the writing on the wall</span></b>, from Daniel\u00a05:5: \u201cSuddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote.\u201d\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tBelshazzar was a king of Babylon whose sin and theft from Jerusalem\u2019s First Temple doomed him. At a feast, the hand of God appeared and wrote out a blazing message on the wall. The prophet Daniel alone could read God\u2019s message: Belshazzar\u2019s soul was wicked, his death had been arranged, and his kingdom would be conquered. So rarely was God\u2019s plan for a human made so public; \u201cseeing the writing on the wall\u201d has become an idiom for recognizing the obvious signs of an imminent outcome (especially a terrible one).\r\n\t</li>",
                "<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">(casting) pearls before swine</span></b>, from Matthew\u00a07:6: \u201cGive not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.\u201d\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tThe \u201cpearls before swine\u201d analogy comes from Jesus\u2019s Sermon on the Mount, where he exhorts his followers to preach his teachings, but to not waste time on those who do not welcome the message. A similar message appears later in Matthew in the form of another common idiom: Jesus advises followers \u201cshake the dust from your feet\u201d when leaving places where their preaching goes unheeded. Both phrases have lost their religious overtones in regular usage: \u201cpearls before swine\u201d identifies something valuable or beautiful that goes unappreciated, while \u201cshaking the dust from your feet\u201d often describes an ambitious person moving out of a small town.\r\n\t</li>",
                "<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Good Samaritan</span></b> (from Luke\u00a010:30, \u201cBut a Samaritan, who was on a journey, came upon him; and when he saw him, he felt compassion.\u201d\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tThe Good Samaritan appears in a namesake parable of Jesus about a Jewish traveler who is robbed, bloodied, and left on the road, where two travelers pass him by before a traveling Samaritan gives him generous, selfless aid. The emphasis in the parable is that the Samaritan is good despite Samaritans\u2019 general hatred of Jews; the parable is created by Jesus to answer the question of who is truly a man\u2019s neighbor, the implicit answer being every man. The directness of the parable has left its original sense wholly intact: today, a \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d is someone who stops to help, regardless of circumstance or inconvenience.\r\n\t</li>",
                "<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">ye of little faith</span></b>, from Matthew\u00a06:30, \u201cIf God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?\u201d\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tUttered in modern English in response to doubters and critics, this phrase occurs in the context of a passage known as \u201cThe Lilies of the Field\u201d or \u201cThe Birds of the Air\u201d in another section of Jesus\u2019s Sermon on the Mount. To comfort those who worry about survival and day-to-day life, Jesus tells his followers, \u201cConsider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin. And yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\u201d Thus, Jesus claims that if a person devotes themself to God, they must trust that God will eventually reward and protect them. Today, the phrase is often used outside of any religious context, as a (sometimes sarcastic) rebuke.\r\n\t</li>"

Abraham, who was originally from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ur of the Chaldeans</span></b>, is promised the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">land of Canaan</span></b>, which he enters with his wife <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sarah</span></b> and his nephew <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lot</span></b>. To test Abraham\u2019s faithfulness, the Lord orders him to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sacrifice his son Isaac</span></b> on Mount Moriah; Abraham complies, but at the last second, he is stopped by an angel and given a ram to sacrifice instead. Abraham then makes a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">covenant</span></b> with the Lord, who promises that his descendants will be as numerous as the stars of the sky and the sands of the seashore. In Islamic tradition, Abraham (known as Ibrahim) is instead told to sacrifice his son Ishmael, whose mother is the concubine Hagar. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are collectively known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Abrahamic religions</span></b> due to Abraham\u2019s central role in the scriptures of all three.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Jacob</span></b> is the third and final patriarch in the Book of Genesis, the son of Isaac and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rebekah</span></b>. In Isaac\u2019s old age, he intends to bless Jacob\u2019s elder twin brother <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Esau</span></b>, but Jacob wears goatskins to impersonate his sibling and receives the blessing instead. While traveling to his uncle Laban to escape Esau\u2019s wrath, he has a vision of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">angels moving up and down a ladder to heaven</span></b>. After working for seven years, he is given Laban\u2019s daughter <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Leah</span></b> in marriage, but works another seven years to marry Laban\u2019s daughter <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rachel</span></b> instead. His name is changed to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Israel</span></b> after he spends a night wrestling with an angel; the angel defeats him by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">striking his hip socket</span></b>, which is why Jewish law forbids eating the sciatic muscle. Jacob\u2019s sons become the heads of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Twelve Tribes of Israel</span></b>; his son <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joseph</span></b> receives a coat of many colors, is sold into slavery by his brothers, and becomes vizier for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pharaoh of Egypt</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Moses</span></b> leads the Israelites during the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Exodus</span></b>, freeing them from their <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">captivity in Egypt</span></b>. He is abandoned in a basket as a child and is raised by the pharaoh\u2019s daughter. After killing an Egyptian overseer, he flees to the land of Midian, where the Lord appears to him in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">burning bush</span></b>. Moses and his brother <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aaron</span></b> go before the pharaoh to request he release the Israelites from bondage. When the pharaoh refuses, the Lord afflicts Egypt with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ten Plagues</span></b>, the last of which causes the death of every first-born male child. The Israelites avoid this by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">painting their doorposts with lamb\u2019s blood</span></b>, a ritual that leads to the establishment of the holiday of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Passover</span></b>. Moses then leads the Israelites out of Egypt by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">parting the Red Sea</span></b>, after which they spend 40\u00a0years wandering in the desert. Moses receives the tablets of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ten Commandments</span></b> from the Lord on Mount Sinai, but smashes them in anger when he sees the people worshipping a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">golden calf</span></b>. Moses dies before entering the Promised Land and is succeeded by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joshua</span></b> as the leader of the Israelites. Since the books of the Jewish Torah (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) are attributed to Moses, the rules set forth in the Torah are known as the Mosaic Law.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Samson</span></b> is the last of twelve namesake leaders of Israel in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Book of Judges</span></b>. He possesses <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">superhuman strength</span></b> as he never cuts his hair. After falling in love with a Philistine woman and preparing to marry her, Samson tells the groomsmen a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">riddle</span></b> involving honey in the carcass of a lion; the groomsmen force his betrothed to tell them the answer. Samson\u2019s betrothed is eventually married to another man, causing an enraged Samson to burn the Philistines\u2019 crops and slay 1,000 men with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">jawbone of a donkey</span></b>. Samson\u2019s downfall comes when he falls in love with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Delilah</span></b>, who seduces him for the secret of his strength, then cuts his hair while he is asleep. He is captured and blinded by the Philistines, who display him in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Temple of Dagon</span></b>. However, he regains his strength and collapses the temple, killing himself and everyone else inside.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Samuel</span></b> is a prophet and the namesake of the two books that follow Ruth and precede 1\u00a0Kings. Samuel\u2019s mother, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hannah</span></b>, prays to the Lord for a child, and promises that should she conceive a son she will dedicate him to the service of the Lord. Shortly thereafter, Hannah becomes pregnant with Samuel. When Samuel is a young boy, the Lord calls to him during the night, though he mistakes the voice for that of the head priest <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eli</span></b>, whose downfall he subsequently foretells. As an adult, Samuel leads Israel to a major victory over the Philistines at Mizpah, erecting the stone Ebenezer on the site. At the Israelites\u2019 request, he <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">anoints Saul</span></b> as the first king of Israel; Saul eventually loses his favor by sparing King Agag of the Amalekites in battle. After Samuel\u2019s death, Saul calls upon the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Witch of Endor</span></b> to summon up Samuel\u2019s ghost; Samuel\u2019s spirit predicts a crushing defeat for Israel at the hands of the Philistines.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">David</span></b> is a son of Jesse of Bethlehem. David succeeded Saul as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">King of Israel</span></b> and is traditionally held to be a direct ancestor of Jesus. David first takes command of Israel\u2019s army after he uses a simple sling to slay the massive Philistine champion <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Goliath</span></b>, an event depicted in sculpture by Michelangelo and Donatello, among others. Though Saul becomes jealous of David and tries to kill him, David escapes with the help of Saul\u2019s son <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jonathan</span></b>, with whom he shares a deep relationship that some modern scholars have interpreted as romantic. As king, David captures the city of Jerusalem and installs the Ark of the Covenant there. He falls in love with the married woman <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bathsheba</span></b> and sends her husband Uriah the Hittite to be killed in battle; this earns him a strong rebuke from the prophet Nathan. David\u2019s children include <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Absalom</span></b>, who leads a rebellion against him. David is recognized as the traditional author of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Psalms</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Solomon</span></b> is a son of David who succeeds his father as king. As a young man, Solomon is visited by the Lord, who asks what Solomon desires; Solomon\u2019s reply of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cwisdom\u201d</span></b> pleased the Lord, who granted the request. In the best-known episode illustrating Solomon\u2019s wisdom, he orders that a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">child be cut in half</span></b> to determine its true mother. Under Solomon\u2019s rule, Israel built the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">First Temple of Jerusalem</span></b>, also known as the Temple of Solomon, whose innermost chamber housed the Ark of the Covenant. Solomon amassed great wealth and had 700 wives. In a short episode that inspired numerous artists, Solomon was visited by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Queen of Sheba</span></b>. Traditionally, Solomon is considered the author of the books of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Proverbs</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ecclesiastes</span></b>, and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Song of Solomon</span></b> (or Song of Songs), as well as the deuterocanonical Wisdom of Solomon.</li>",

Elijah denounces Ahab\u2019s worship of Baal and predicts a three-year <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">drought</span></b>, after which he <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">flees into the wilderness</span></b> and is fed by ravens. During this time, Elijah stays with a widow in the town of Zarephath and performs miracles such as multiplying her flour supply and raising her son from the dead. At the end of the drought, Elijah challenges the priests of Baal to a dramatic contest on Mount Carmel where he <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">summons fire from heaven</span></b> to ignite a burnt offering. Elijah\u2019s mission is carried on by his student <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Elisha</span></b>, who asks for a \u201cdouble portion\u201d of Elijah\u2019s spirit as Elijah bodily ascends to Heaven, carried up on a chariot of fire. Elijah also appears briefly in the New Testament, when both he and Moses converse with Jesus during the Transfiguration. In Jewish tradition, Elijah will appear to herald the coming of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Messiah</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Daniel</span></b> is a Jew who is brought to the court of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nebuchadnezzar\u00a0II</span></b> during the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jewish captivity</span></b> in Babylon. Daniel <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">interprets dreams</span></b> for the king, including one in which an enormous statue represents four successive kingdoms that will supplant Babylon, and another predicting that Nebuchadnezzar will suffer from seven years of madness. In one episode, Nebuchadnezzar casts Daniel\u2019s friends <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego</span></b> into a furnace, but all three emerge unscathed. Daniel also serves the later ruler <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Belshazzar</span></b> and interprets a mysterious hand that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">writes on the wall</span></b> during a feast, predicting Belshazzar\u2019s downfall\u2014which comes that night. In the best-known episode from Daniel\u2019s life, Darius the Mede casts Daniel into a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">lion\u2019s den</span></b> after Daniel disobeys an order not to worship the god of Israel; after Daniel emerges unharmed, Darius has those who accused Daniel thrown into the lion\u2019s den instead, where they are killed.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Jonah</span></b> is a minor prophet sent by God to preach repentance to the city of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nineveh</span></b>. Jonah is reluctant to do so and instead boards a ship to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tarshish</span></b>, but God sends a massive storm to disrupt his journey. Jonah is cast overboard by the crew and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">swallowed by a large fish</span></b>, which spits him onto the shore after three days. Jonah eventually continues on to Nineveh and convinces its inhabitants to repent by donning sackcloth and ashes. Indignant that God spared the city from destruction, Jonah sits outside the city, where God causes a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gourd</span></b> to grow over him and provide him shade. A worm then devours the gourd, exposing him to the heat of the Sun; God uses Jonah\u2019s suffering to show Jonah that he should have <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pity</span></b> on the people of Nineveh. The Book of Jonah is traditionally read in the afternoon on the Jewish holiday of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Yom Kippur</span></b>.</li>",

The scene opens with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">King Claudius</span></b> conversing with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</span></b> about the cause of Hamlet\u2019s melancholy. To determine if Hamlet\u2019s state is due to love for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ophelia</span></b>, Claudius and Polonius (Ophelia\u2019s father), ask Ophelia to speak with Hamlet while they listen in. Hamlet subsequently enters, delivering one of the most famous soliloquies in all of literature:\r\n\t\t<blockquote>\r\n\t\t\tTo be, or not to be, that is the question:\r\n\t\t\tWhether \u2019tis nobler in the mind to suffer\r\n\t\t\tThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br/>\r\n\t\t\tOr to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,<br/>\r\n\t\t\tAnd by opposing end them.\r\n\t\t</blockquote>\r\n\t\tHamlet ponders whether death is preferable to the suffering of living, noting that\r\n\t\t<blockquote>\r\n\t\t\tTo die, to sleep,<br/>\r\n\t\t\tto sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there\u2019s the rub<br/>\r\n\t\t\tFor in that sleep of death, what dreams may come.\r\n\t\t</blockquote>\r\n\t\tHamlet goes on to refer to death as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cundiscovered country,\u201d</span></b> before noting that due to the unknown \u201cills\u201d of death, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cconscience does make cowards of us all.\u201d</span></b>\n</li>",

Prior to Antony\u2019s address, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Brutus</span></b> claims that his participation in the conspirators\u2019 murder of Caesar was due to his love of Rome, claiming that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cas [Caesar] was ambitious, I slew him.\u201d</span></b> Antony subsequently draws the attention of the crowd by exhorting <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cFriends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.\u201d</span></b> Antony begins by claiming\r\n\t\t<blockquote>\n<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</span></b><br/>\r\n\t\t\tThe evil that men do lives after them,<br/>\r\n\t\t\tThe good is oft interred with their bones;<br/>\r\n\t\t\tSo let it be with Caesar.\r\n\t\t</blockquote>\r\n\t\tAntony concedes that if Caesar was ambitious, \u201cit was a grievous fault,\u00a0/ And grievously hath Caesar answer\u2019d it.\u201d While tacitly acknowledging that Brutus and the conspirators are \u201chonorable men,\u201d Antony proceeds to counter their claim, noting that Caesar brought wealth to Rome via the ransoms of his captives, and that Caesar cared for the poor. He states\r\n\t\t<blockquote>\r\n\t\t\tYou all did see that on the Lupercal<br/>\r\n\t\t\tI thrice presented him a kingly crown,<br/>\r\n\t\t\tWhich he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?\r\n\t\t</blockquote>\r\n\t\tAntony concludes with a flourish, lamenting \u201c<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar</span></b>\u00a0/ And I must pause till it come back to me.\u201d Antony\u2019s speech immediately turns public opinion against the conspirators.\r\n\t</li>",

A desperate <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Orlando</span></b> has come upon the exiled Duke\u2019s camp in the Forest of Arden, and demands food, threatening force if necessary, but the Duke warmly welcomes him. The sight of Orlando prompts Jaques to deliver a monologue noting\r\n\t\t<blockquote>\r\n\t\t\tAll the world\u2019s a stage,<br/>\r\n\t\t\tAnd all the men and women merely players;<br/>\r\n\t\t\tThey have their exits and their entrances,<br/>\r\n\t\t\tAnd one man in his time plays many parts,<br/>\r\n\t\t\tHis acts being seven ages,\r\n\t\t</blockquote>\r\n\t\tgiving the passage its alternate title, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">the Seven Ages of Man</span></b>.

Macbeth hears a \u201cshriek\u201d that he notes would have terrified him earlier in his life, but not after the \u201chorrors\u201d he has experienced in the play. Subsequently, Seyton informs him the cry was the death of Lady Macbeth, prompting Macbeth to muse \u201cTomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,\u00a0/ Creeps in this petty pace from day to day.\u201d Macbeth likens death to the extinguishing of a flame, stating \u201cOut, out, brief candle!\u201d before noting that\r\n\t\t<blockquote>\r\n\t\t\tLife\u2019s but a walking shadow, a poor player<br/>\r\n\t\t\tThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage<br/>\r\n\t\t\tAnd then is heard no more. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">It is a tale<br/>\r\n\t\t\tTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury<br/>\r\n\t\t\tSignifying nothing.</span></b>\n</blockquote>\r\n\t\tWilliam Faulkner adapted the soliloquy\u2019s penultimate line for the title of his novel The Sound and the Fury.\r\n\t</li>",

In the very first lines of the play, Richard remarks on the ascension of Edward\u00a0IV amidst the Wars of the Roses, stating <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cNow is the winter of our discontent\u00a0/ Made glorious summer by this son of York.\u201d</span></b> Richard notes that Edward, having taken the throne, no longer rides into battle, but \u201ccapers nimbly in a lady\u2019s chamber.\u201d Richard, however, is an ugly, deformed, hunchback, describing himself as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201crudely stamp\u2019d\u201d</span></b> and lamenting that \u201cdogs bark at me as I halt by them.\u201d He resolves that\r\n\t\t<blockquote>\r\n\t\t\tsince I cannot prove a lover,<br/>\r\n\t\t\tTo entertain these fair well-spoken days,<br/>\n<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">I am determined to prove a villain</span></b>\n</blockquote>\r\n\t\tand describes the plot he has hatched to pit Edward against Richard\u2019s brother Clarence.

Having fallen in love with Juliet after seeing her at Capulet\u2019s ball, Romeo sneaks into the garden under her balcony to try and meet with her. Spying her at her window, he exclaims <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBut, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?\u00a0/ It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\u201d</span></b> Romeo watches and notes that Juliet is speaking to the stars; after he hears her voice the first time, he urges \u201cO, speak again, bright angel!\u201d Juliet\u2014who does not realize Romeo is listening\u2014longs for him, calling out <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cO Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?\u201d</span></b> Juliet laments that the feud between their families forbids their love, urging Romeo <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cdeny thy father and refuse thy name\u201d</span></b> before musing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cWhat\u2019s in a name? that which we call a rose\u00a0/ By any other name would smell as sweet.\u201d</span></b> Romeo subsequently reveals himself, and the two lovers speak to one another for the first time.</li>",

Although <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> contains many anti-Semitic elements, scholars have noted that Shakespeare\u2019s characterization of Shylock also includes sympathetic moments. The messenger Salarino asks what good Shylock will get from the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pound of flesh</span></b> he plans to extract from Antonio. Shylock responds by stating <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cif it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge\u201d</span></b> before listing the extensive injuries Antonio has inflicted upon him, concluding <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cand what\u2019s his reason? I am a Jew.\u201d</span></b> Noting that Jews are human beings like Christians, Shylock asks <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cHath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?\u201d</span></b> He goes on to note \u201c<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">If you prick us, do we not bleed?</span></b> if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?\u201d Shylock explains that since Christians may seek revenge against Jews that wrong them, he is only responding in kind, pointing out the hypocrisy and noting <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cThe villainy you teach me I will execute.\u201d</span></b></li>",

Prospero has blessed the impending <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">marriage of his daughter Miranda to Ferdinand</span></b>, the son of Alonso, and uses his magic to make the spirit Ariel present a masque featuring the goddesses Iris, Ceres, and Juno. However, Prospero interrupts the dancing when he realizes he must deal with a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">conspiracy involving Caliban</span></b>. Noticing the disappointment of Ferdinand, Prospero reminds him that the play\u2014like both life and the world entire\u2014was fleeting, stating\r\n\t\t<blockquote>\r\n\t\t\tOur revels now are ended.
