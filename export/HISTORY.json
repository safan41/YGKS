In 1972 Amin expelled tens of thousands of Asians from Uganda. Amin allowed Palestinian hijackers to land a captured Air France plane at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Entebbe Airport</span></b> in 1976; Jewish hostages on board were freed by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Operation Thunderbolt</span></b>, an Israeli commando operation during which Yonatan Netanyahu, the older brother of the future Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was killed.

He was the first African leader to declare independence from a colonial power. Nkrumah supported <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pan-Africanism</span></b>, an ideology that proposed continent-wide cooperation and union of African peoples. His regime racked up large debts through military reform and the building of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Akosombo Dam</span></b> to create <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lake Volta</span></b>.

(Tanzania was formed by the 1964 merger of Tanganyika with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zanzibar</span></b>.) Tanganyika gained independence before Nyerere came to power due to negotiations between Nyerere and British Governor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Richard Turnbull</span></b>. Nyerere put forward his socialist plans in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Arusha Declaration</span></b> of 1967. His policies were known by the term <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ujamaa</span></b>, signifying family unity in Swahili. Under his leadership, literacy improved significantly, but poverty remained high, especially among rural laborers uprooted by Nyerere\u2019s centralized economic planning.

When Truman was nominated by the Democrats in 1948, members from the South stormed out of the convention, creating a further divide within the party. With South Carolina governor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Strom Thurmond</span></b> as its candidate, the Dixiecrats \u2014 while receiving the same amount of votes as Henry Wallace \u2014 won 39 electoral votes from four southern states. Though it was a temporary split, the issue of civil rights did not disappear.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Communist Party of the United States of America</span></b> (established 1919) is notable mainly for attempts to outlaw it, such as the 1940 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Smith Act</span></b> which criminalized organizations advocating the violent overthrow of the government, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Communist Control Act</span></b> of 1954, and the inquiries of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">House Un-American Activities Committee</span></b> and Senators <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Richard Nixon</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joseph McCarthy</span></b>. Though the 1951 Supreme Court case <i class=\"ygk-term\">Dennis v. U.S.</i> ruled that there is no First-Amendment right to advocate the overthrow of the government, general concerns about freedom of speech and overreach in investigations of Communists put an end to prosecutions of individuals solely for belonging to the Communist Party by the early 1960s. The CPUSA ran <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Gus Hall</span></b> for President four times, but was never a significant force at the ballot box. In 1995, a cache of Soviet documents known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">VENONA</span></b> was published, revealing that the CPUSA was controlled by Moscow.

                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">American Independent Party</span></b> (established 1967) was a sort of spiritual successor to the Dixiecrats from two decades before.

Running on a platform of segregation once again proved appealing to the South, as Wallace won 46 electoral votes from five states, and 13% of the vote with nearly ten million votes. Many Wallace supporters, including the organizers of the AIP, later joined the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">U.S. Taxpayers Party</span></b>, which was renamed the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Constitution Party</span></b>, and still exists as a small party to the right of the Republicans.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Reform Party</span></b> (established 1995) was created to follow up on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ross Perot</span></b>\u2019s 1992 independent campaign for President, in which he won 19% of the popular vote but no electoral votes, making him the most successful alternative candidate by vote count since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. Reform Party members agreed on the need for a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">balanced budget</span></b> and changes to the electoral process, and were generally opposed to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">free trade agreements</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">immigration</span></b>. The lack of a unified platform on other issues led to constant infighting over the party\u2019s goals and an inability to capitalize on Perot\u2019s initial success. Perot ran under the Reform banner again in the 1996 election, taking 8% of the vote. The Reform Party is perhaps best known for candidate <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jesse Ventura</span></b>\u2019s surprise victory in the 1998 election for governor of Minnesota. In the 2000 election cycle, a conservative faction led by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pat Buchanan</span></b> took over the party, leading to the departure of many Perot supporters and effectively ending the party.

Although Ramses proclaimed a great victory for himself, he was lucky to achieve a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">stalemate</span></b> after being ambushed by Hittite <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">chariots</span></b>. Kadesh was probably the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">largest chariot battle in history</span></b>, with over 5,000 chariots engaged. The Egyptian chariots were smaller and faster than those used by the Hittites, which gave the Egyptians an advantage.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Persian</span></b> King <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Darius\u00a0I</span></b>\u2019s invasion of mainland <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Greece</span></b> ended with a decisive victory for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Miltiades</span></b> and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Athenians</span></b> at <b><span class=\"label\">Marathon</span></b> (490\u00a0BC).

Among the few Athenian dead of the battle were archon <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Callimachus</span></b> and the general <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stesilaos</span></b>. Legend has it that the Greek messenger <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pheidippides</span></b> ran to Athens with news of the victory, but collapsed upon arrival.

The battle is named after an island in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Saronic Gulf</span></b> near <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Athens</span></b>. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Xerxes</span></b> was so confident in victory that he watched the battle from a throne on the slopes of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mount Aegaleus</span></b>. The Athenian general <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Themistocles</span></b> devised a plan to lure the large, slow Persian ships into the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">narrow straits</span></b>, where the Greek ships were able to outmaneuver and destroy much of the Persian fleet. The Persian admiral <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ariabignes</span></b> was killed in hand-to-hand combat, and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Queen of Halicarnassus, Artemisia</span></b>, had to sink some of her allies\u2019 ships to escape.</li>",

The battle began when Caesar besieged <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Vercingetorix</span></b> in the town of Alesia, shortly after the Roman defeat at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Gergovia</span></b>. The Romans built a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">wall</span></b> to surround the city (a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201ccircumvallation\u201d</span></b>) and a second wall around that (a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201ccontravallation\u201d</span></b>) to protect themselves from the Gaulish <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">relief army</span></b> under <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Commius</span></b>. When Commius launched a massive attack on the Romans, Caesar was able to defeat him and force the surrender of Vercingetorix.

Following his victory in the battle, Octavian titled himself <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Princeps</span></b>, and later <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Augustus</span></b>.

                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Battle of the Milvian Bridge</span></b> (AD\u00a0312) was part of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">civil war</span></b> that ensued when <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Maxentius</span></b> usurped the throne of the western half of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Roman Empire</span></b> from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Constantine</span></b>. Prior to the battle, Constantine supposedly had a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">vision of God</span></b> promising victory to his forces if he painted his shields with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chi-Rho</span></b>, a Christian symbol. Constantine was indeed victorious, and Maxentius <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">drowned in the Tiber River</span></b> during the battle.

Wycliffe is best known today for being <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">one of the first to translate the Bible into English</span></b> (the first of his translations came out in 1382 and circulated widely). He and the Lollards also challenged the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">privileged status of the clergy</span></b>, calling at various times for a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">lay clergy</span></b>, an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">end to clerical celibacy</span></b>, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">end of confession</span></b> to priests, and a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ban on priests holding temporal offices</span></b>. The Lollards were driven underground, especially after the suppression of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">1414 uprising</span></b> by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sir John Oldcastle</span></b>, but their ideas presaged many of those later adopted during the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">English Reformation</span></b>. In the wake of Oldcastle\u2019s Rebellion, Wycliffe was posthumously declared a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">heretic</span></b> at the 1415 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Council of Constance</span></b>, after which his corpse was exhumed and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">posthumously beheaded</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Puritans</span></b> (16th and 17th centuries) The Puritans were English <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Protestants</span></b> in the 16th and 17th centuries who tried to push the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">English Reformation</span></b> further by \u201cpurifying\u201d the Church of England of any remaining <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Roman Catholic influences</span></b>. The word \u201cPuritan\u201d is applied inconsistently to groups espousing a variety of different religious positions; today, it often refers to somebody who is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">opposed to seeking pleasure</span></b>. When studying 17th-century England, it is important to note the distinction between <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cseparatist\u201d Puritans</span></b>, who wanted to break away from the Church of England, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cnon-separatist\u201d Puritans</span></b>, who wanted to reform the church while remaining members of it. The Pilgrims who sailed on the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Mayflower</i> were separatists; the main group of colonists who founded the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Massachusetts Bay Colony</span></b> under <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Winthrop</span></b> were non-separatists. After the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">English Civil War</span></b>, under the leadership of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Oliver Cromwell</span></b>, Puritans enjoyed a brief period of power in England, during which time they <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">closed theaters</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">limited sports</span></b>, and instituted harsh <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">penalties for breaking the Sabbath</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Levellers</span></b> and <b><span class=\"label\">Diggers</span></b> (mid-17th century) During the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">English Civil War</span></b>, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">opponents of the monarchy</span></b> included holders of a wide range of political beliefs. Those <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">politicians</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">soldiers</span></b> who wanted to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">extend suffrage</span></b> and establish <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">equality before the law</span></b> were known as Levellers, a pejorative term probably referring to the fact that they wanted all people to live on a common level. Some radicals, inspired by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Book of Acts</span></b>, went even further in attempting to establish <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">egalitarianism in the English countryside</span></b> by trying to farm on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">common land</span></b>. Because they dug up this land, they became known as Diggers, but preferred to call themselves the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cTrue Levellers.\u201d</span></b> The Levellers, who were less radical than the Diggers, had considerably more influence on English politics. Several Leveller leaders were invited to debate the main leaders of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">New Model Army</span></b> during the 1647 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Putney Debates</span></b> about the formation of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">new English constitution</span></b>.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Luddites</span></b> (early 19th century) As the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Industrial Revolution</span></b> accelerated in the early 19th century, many skilled <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">textile workers</span></b> were replaced by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unskilled laborers</span></b> who could use newly invented machines. The most vocal opponents of textile mechanization were known as Luddites, a term said to have derived from the surname of a youth named <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ned Ludd</span></b>, who broke two <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">stocking frames</span></b> in 1779. Between 1811 and 1813, organized groups of Luddites clashed with the British military at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mills</span></b> in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nottinghamshire</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Yorkshire</span></b>. In response, Parliament passed the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Frame Breaking Act</span></b>, which made <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">industrial sabotage</span></b> a capital crime. While the Luddites were suppressed relatively quickly, the perpetrators of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Swing Riots</span></b> in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kent</span></b> in 1830 employed similar tactics by demolishing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">threshing machines</span></b> to protest the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mechanization of agriculture</span></b>. Today, the term \u201cLuddite\u201d refers more generally to anybody who is uncomfortable with technology.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Chartists</span></b> (19th century) Another <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">working-class</span></b> reform movement in industrial England was the Chartist movement, so named because it advocated the adoption of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">People\u2019s Charter of 1838</span></b>. The Charter was written by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">six members of Parliament and six workers</span></b>. It called for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">democratization</span></b> of the political system by instituting <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">universal suffrage</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">secret ballots</span></b>, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">abolition of property qualifications</span></b> to stand for election, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">salaries for members of Parliament</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">constituencies of equal size</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">annual parliamentary elections</span></b>. The Chartist movement inspired several mass <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">rallies</span></b>, peaking in size in 1848 as the rest of Europe was swept up in revolution. The Chartist movement did not directly inspire any political reforms, but Parliament gradually granted five of the six demands of the Charter (the demand for annual elections was the only one never implemented).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Anti-Corn Law League</span></b> (early-mid 19th century) From 1838 to 1846, the leading organization agitating for repeal of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Corn Laws</span></b> was the Anti-Corn Law League. The Corn Laws were a series of laws that imposed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tariffs on imported grain</span></b> (\u201ccorn\u201d was at that time a generic term for types of grain that require grinding, including <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">wheat</span></b>), which kept grain prices high to benefit English landowners. The founders of the Anti-Corn Law League, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Richard Cobden</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Bright</span></b>, argued that importing grain would <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">lower food prices</span></b> for workers and thus stimulate the British economy. The Corn Laws were eventually repealed in 1846 under the leadership of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Conservative Prime Minister Robert Peel</span></b>, a decision hastened by the start of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Irish Potato Famine</span></b> the previous year. The repeal of the Corn Laws ushered in an era of support for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">free trade</span></b> that continues to this day. Another legacy of opposition to the Corn Laws was the founding of the weekly publication <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Economist</i> in 1843 to promote repeal of trade restrictions.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Reform League</span></b>(mid-late 19th century) A variety of organizations, including the Reform League, sprung up in 1865 to promote <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">universal suffrage</span></b> in the United Kingdom. Universal suffrage had been one of the demands of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chartist Movement</span></b>, but Parliament had not enacted it. The Reform League staged <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mass meetings</span></b> to influence parliamentary proceedings, including a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">rally in Hyde Park</span></b> in 1866 that forced the resignation of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Spencer Walpole</span></b> as Home Secretary. The Reform League\u2019s platform was eventually enacted in 1867, during <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Benjamin Disraeli</span></b>\u2019s prime ministry. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Second Reform Act of 1867</span></b> enfranchised urban working-class males in England and Wales (further bills enfranchised Scotland and Ireland the following year).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Fabian Society</span></b> (1884\u2013present) One of the most influential <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">intellectual communities</span></b> in British history was the Fabian Society, an organization founded in 1884 to promote the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gradual adoption of socialism</span></b>. The society was named for the Roman general <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Fabius Maximus</span></b>, who avoided fighting pitched battles against <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hannibal</span></b> and instead won a gradual <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">war of attrition</span></b>. The Fabian Society pressed for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">progressive economic measures</span></b> that went far <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">beyond the platform of the Liberal Party</span></b>, including a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">minimum wage</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">universal health care</span></b>. Prominent members of the Fabian Society included <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George Bernard Shaw</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">H.\u00a0G. Wells</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Virginia Woolf</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ramsay MacDonald</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sidney and Beatrice Webb</span></b>. In 1900, many members of the Fabian Society founded the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Labour Party</span></b>, a socialist rival to the two major parties, which eventually came to power in 1924 under <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ramsay MacDonald</span></b>. Today, the Fabian Society continues to exist as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">left-wing think tank</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Suffragettes</span></b> (early 20th century) In the early 20th century, many different groups began to clamor for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">voting rights to be extended to women</span></b>. The most militant advocates for women\u2019s suffrage became known as Suffragettes. This term is especially associated with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emmeline Pankhurst</span></b> and her organization, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Women\u2019s Social and Political Union</span></b>. In the 1910s, many Suffragettes adopted <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">militant tactics</span></b> to draw attention to their cause, including <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emily Davison</span></b>\u2019s protest at the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Epsom Derby</span></b> in 1913 when she was trampled and killed by the King\u2019s horse, a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">slashing attack</span></b> by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mary Richardson</span></b> on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Diego Vel\u00e1zquez</span></b>\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Rokeby Venus</i> in 1914, and the 1914 bombing of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Coronation Chair</span></b> inside <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Westminster Abbey</span></b>. Many Suffragettes who were arrested went on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">hunger strikes</span></b>, leading the government of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Herbert Asquith</span></b> to pass the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cat and Mouse Act</span></b>, which allowed hunger strikers to be <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">released and subsequently re-arrested</span></b>. In 1918, Parliament finally extended voting rights to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">women over the age of 30 who met property qualifications</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">National Union of Mineworkers</span></b> (late 20th century) This list would not be complete without some mention of the organizations that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">opposed the conservative economic measures imposed by the government of Margaret Thatcher</span></b> in the 1980s. One conflict that deserves particular attention is the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">strike</span></b> led by the National Union of Mineworkers in 1984 and 1985 under the leadership of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Arthur Scargill</span></b>. The entire British <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">coal industry</span></b> had been <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">nationalized</span></b> by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Clement Attlee</span></b>\u2019s Labour government in 1947. In 1984, the Thatcher government announced a plan to close 20 coal mining pits as a way of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">reducing government subsidies</span></b> to the mines, which precipitated a strike. By March 1985, the Thatcher government had outlasted the strikers, effectively breaking the power of one of Britain\u2019s most powerful unions. The British coal industry was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">privatized</span></b> in 1994. Today, most of Britain\u2019s coal is imported, and the former mining areas have some of the highest <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unemployment</span></b> rates in the country.</li>"

The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">heavy casualties sustained by both sides</span></b> on Okinawa and the suicidal bravery of the Japanese military <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">encouraged American planners to use atomic weapons</span></b> on Hiroshima and Nagasaki instead of launching <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Operation Downfall</span></b>, the projected late-1945 conventional invasion of the Japanese home islands.\n\t\t</li>",
                "<ul class=\"ygk\">\n<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Sino-Japanese War</span></b> (1937\u20131945):\n\t\t\t<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Japan\u2019s invasion of China</span></b> was the primary cause of World War\u00a0II in East Asia. As early as 1931, Japanese forces <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">occupied Manchuria</span></b> and set up a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">puppet state called Manchukuo</span></b>. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Marco Polo Bridge Incident</span></b> of 1937 resulted in open war between Japan and China. Japanese forces committed notorious <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">atrocities</span></b> during the invasion of China, including the 1937 massacres known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rape of Nanking</span></b>. The Chinese war effort was hindered by internal conflict between <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chiang Kai-Shek</span></b>\u2019s Nationalist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kuomintang</span></b> government and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">communist insurgency</span></b> led by Mao Zedong. Between 1942 and 1945 central China was largely <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cut off from the outside world</span></b> due to Japanese <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">conquest of coastal ports</span></b>; Allied support was limited to air power deployed over the Himalayas from India, including the fighter pilots known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cFlying Tigers.\u201d</span></b>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Attack on Pearl Harbor</span></b> (December\u00a01941):\n\t\t\tJapanese plans for domination of the Pacific called for a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">surprise attack</span></b> on the U.S. Navy base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii; wrecking the American Pacific Fleet would allow the Japanese navy to invade southeast Asia with minimal opposition. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto</span></b> planned the Japanese strike, which sent carrier-based <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dive bombers</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">torpedo bombers</span></b> to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Oahu</span></b> on Sunday, December\u00a07, 1941. Four American battleships, including the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">USS\u00a0<i>Arizona</i></span></b>, were sunk; the American <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">aircraft carriers were at sea</span></b> away from Pearl Harbor at the time of the attack. The losses sustained at Pearl Harbor shocked the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">previously neutral</span></b> United States into entering World War\u00a0II. President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s address to Congress described December\u00a07 as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cdate which will live in infamy.\u201d</span></b>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">Battle of Bataan</span></b> (January to May\u00a01942):\n\t\t\tImmediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese bombers struck the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Philippine island Luzon</span></b>, forcing the Americans to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">retreat</span></b> to the Bataan Peninsula, where they held out for four months. General Douglas MacArthur vowed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cI shall return\u201d</span></b> before <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">evacuating to Australia</span></b> and leaving command to Jonathan Wainwright, who retreated to the island of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Corregidor</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">surrendered</span></b> on May\u00a06.

Allied troops were driven back toward Singapore, Britain\u2019s major base in the Far East. Reinforcements from Britain and Australia arrived too late to repair the situation, and British general <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Arthur Percival</span></b> was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">forced to surrender</span></b> in February 1942. The loss of Singapore stunned the British Empire.

Although the Zhou ruled for nearly 800 years, during much of the time period real power lay in the hands of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">feudal lords</span></b>. The sacking of the Zhou capital by barbarians in 771\u00a0BC marks the beginning of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eastern Zhou</span></b> and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Spring and Autumn Period</span></b> (771\u00a0BC \u2013 476\u00a0BC). During the Spring and Autumn Period, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hundred Schools of Thought</span></b> (including <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Confucianism</span></b>) flourished, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sun Tzu</span></b> wrote his <i class=\"ygk-term\">Art of War</i>. The end of the Zhou era devolved into the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Warring States period</span></b> (476\u00a0BC \u2013 221\u00a0BC), during which power coalesced into <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">seven independent feudal states</span></b>. The state of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Qin</span></b> eventually grew powerful and efficient enough that it was able to defeat the other six states and complete the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unification of China</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Qin <b><span class=\"pg\">\u201cchin\u201d</span></b> dynasty</span></b> (221\u2013206\u00a0BC), despite its short duration, is usually considered the origin of many of the institutions of imperial China. The founding emperor, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Qin Shi Huangdi</span></b> (usually shorted as Qin Shi Huang), has gained an ill-deserved reputation in traditional Chinese historiography because he <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">destroyed many Confucian texts</span></b> in his infamous <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">book burning</span></b>. Qin Shi Huang also <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">standardized weight measurements</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unified the Chinese script</span></b>, and used <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">conscripts</span></b> to build the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Great Wall</span></b>. After his death, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">suicide of the crown prince</span></b> led to a period of incompetent rule and revolts that caused the collapse of the Qin dynasty.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Han dynasty</span></b> (206\u00a0BC \u2013 AD\u00a0220) is considered a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">golden age</span></b> of Chinese civilization; its influence was so great that the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">majority ethnic group</span></b> in China is still called the Han. Its founder, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Liu Bang</span></b> (later <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emperor Gaozu</span></b>), was born a peasant. Through resourceful recruitment of talented followers and strategic <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">violation of ceasefire</span></b> agreement with his rival <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Xiang Yu</span></b>, Liu Bang managed to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">reunite China</span></b> and established his capital at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chang\u2019an</span></b> (modern <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Xi\u2019an</span></b>). Instability in the early years of the Han dynasty was caused by the depredations of the nomadic <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Xiongnu</span></b>, a problem that was solved by its seventh emperor, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Wudi</span></b>. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emperor Wu</span></b>, considered one of the greatest rulers of China, began a war of conquest against the Xiongnu and greatly <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">expanded China\u2019s frontiers</span></b>. He also <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">formalized China\u2019s bureaucracy</span></b>, sent envoys like <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zhang Qian</span></b> to Central Asia, and established <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Confucianism</span></b> as the official state doctrine. Despite his success, his campaigns <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">drained the treasury</span></b> and his successors were unable to maintain the land he conquered. After a series of poor rulers, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Wang family</span></b> \u2014 who claimed legitimacy through wives of various emperors \u2014 and their leader <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Wang Mang</span></b> toppled the Han dynasty. Wang Mang established the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Xin</span></b> (meaning \u201cnew\u201d) dynasty and attempted to restore the ways of the Zhou dynasty, but he was unable to maintain power because of a catastrophic <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">changing of the course of the Yellow River</span></b>, which spawned <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">peasant protest movements</span></b> like the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Red Eyebrows</span></b>. Eventually, a scion of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Liu</span></b> family \u2014 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Liu Xiu</span></b> \u2014 restored the Han dynasty, moving the capital to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Luoyang</span></b> and establishing the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eastern Han</span></b>. Subsequent rebellions called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Yellow Turbans</span></b> and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Five Pecks of Rice</span></b> hastened the end of the Han dynasty.</li>",
                "<li>The short and turbulent <b><span class=\"label\">period of the Three Kingdoms</span></b> (AD\u00a0184\u2013280) has had an enormous cultural impact thanks to the classic Chinese novel <i class=\"ygk-term\">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>. After a period of disunion, the lands of the former Han dynasty coalesced into three kingdoms: <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cao Wei</span></b> north of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Yangtze</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eastern Wu</span></b> in the lower Yangtze, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Shu Han</span></b> in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sichuan</span></b> region. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Battle of Red Cliffs</span></b> (AD\u00a0208) was fought during this period.  Under the leadership of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sima family</span></b>, Cao Wei managed to defeat the other two kingdoms. The reunification was, however, short-lived. For the next four centuries, China went through a period known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Southern and Northern Dynasties</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Tang dynasty</span></b> (618\u2013907) is considered another <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">golden age</span></b> of Chinese culture: during the Tang period, important poets such as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Li\u00a0Bai</span></b> (or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Li\u00a0Po</span></b>) and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Du\u00a0Fu</span></b> lived, and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">printing press</span></b> was invented. The Tang dynasty reunited China after the collapse of the short-lived <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sui dynasty</span></b>, was ruled by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Li family</span></b>, and had its capital at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chang\u2019an</span></b> (modern day <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Xi\u2019an</span></b>). Its first ruler, like the founder of the Han Dynasty, used the title of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emperor Gaozu</span></b>. Gaozu was forced by his second son, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Li Shimin</span></b> (later <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emperor Taizong</span></b>), to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">abdicate</span></b> after Li Shimin <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">killed two of his brothers</span></b> in an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ambush</span></b>. Despite his bloody path to power, Taizong is considered to be one of the greatest rulers in Chinese history, subjugating much of what is now <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">western China</span></b> and parts of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">central Asia</span></b>. After his death, power came to be concentrated in the hands of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Empress\u00a0Wu</span></b>. Empress\u00a0Wu (or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Wu Zetian</span></b>) was the only woman to become emperor of China, and called her rule the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cSecond Zhou dynasty.\u201d</span></b> Wu was a notable supporter of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Buddhism</span></b> and promoted the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">imperial examination</span></b>, but succession troubles resulted in the premature end of her dynasty. During the reign of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emperor Xuanzong</span></b>, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">An\u00a0Lushan rebellion</span></b> (also called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">An\u00a0Shi rebellion</span></b>) wrecked the foundations of the Tang dynasty. Although it was suppressed, the An\u00a0Lushan rebellion concentrated power in the hands of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">regional military overlords</span></b>. The dynasty had a tumultuous end in 907 that marked the beginning of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Song dynasty</span></b> (960\u20131279) is known for its <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">devotion to cultural activities instead of warfare</span></b> and for the establishment of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Neo-Confucianism</span></b> as state doctrine, with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">imperial examination</span></b> as the primary way of recruiting talent.  It was also during the Song dynasty that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gunpowder</span></b> and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">compass</span></b> were discovered.  The Song dynasty, even in its early years, could not rule all of China proper and was forced to relinquish parts of northern China to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cbarbarian\u201d Liao dynasty</span></b>, paying <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tribute for peace</span></b>. Although like most dynasties, it began as the ventures of a military leader, its first ruler, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Taizu</span></b>, realized that his rival generals could take power from him. He then induced all his major commanders to retire, setting up the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dominance of the scholarly elite over the military elite</span></b> throughout the Song dynasty. This policy was continued by his successors. In the north, however, the Liao dynasty was eventually replaced by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">militaristic Jin dynasty</span></b>, who captured the Song capital, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kaifeng</span></b> along with two Emperors. The remnants of the court fled across the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Yangtze</span></b> and established the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Southern Song</span></b> with a new capital at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hangzhou</span></b>, maintaining peace with the Jin through annual tribute. This state of affairs was brought to an end after the Song dynasty aided the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mongols</span></b> in crushing the Jin, only to discover that they themselves were the next target. Despite the might of the Mongol war machine, the Song dynasty managed to repel major Mongol offensives for nearly 40\u00a0years, before it was finally defeated.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Yuan dynasty</span></b> (1271\u20131368) was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">short-lived</span></b> dynasty established by the invading <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mongols</span></b>, who destroyed the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jin</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Song states</span></b>. Its most notable ruler was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kublai Khan</span></b>, whose <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">invasions of Japan</span></b> were thwarted by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">typhoons</span></b> that the Japanese called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">kamikaze</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cdivine wind.\u201d</span></b> Yuan rulers were hostile to many Chinese institutions, and thus received minimal support from the Chinese elites. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Red Turban rebellion</span></b> of the 1350s marked the beginning of the end for the Yuan.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Ming dynasty</span></b> (1368\u20131644) was the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">last native dynasty</span></b> of China; its rulers came from the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zhu family</span></b>.  The use of the word \u201cchina\u201d to describe <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fine porcelain</span></b> originated from this period, as the Ming were well-known for producing high-quality porcelain. Its founding ruler, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zhu Yuanzhang</span></b> (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emperor Hongwu</span></b>), was a peasant leader of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Red Turbans</span></b> who helped expel the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mongol Yuan rulers</span></b> from China. He was succeeded by his grandson, who quickly lost power to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zhu\u00a0Di</span></b> (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emperor Yongle</span></b>). During the reign of the Yongle emperor, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">eunuch</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zheng\u00a0He</span></b> led <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">treasure fleets</span></b> on seven voyages to display Chinese greatness. Zhu\u00a0Di moved China\u2019s capital to Beijing. After his death, the Ming dynasty <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">banned maritime commerce</span></b>, which left the dynasty vulnerable to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pirates</span></b>. The Ming dynasty came to an end after the rebellion of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Li\u00a0Zicheng</span></b>, which was caused by inadequate government response to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">inflation</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">famine</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">floods</span></b>. Simultaneously, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Manchu people</span></b> \u2014 tributaries of the Ming from northeast China in what is now <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Manchuria</span></b> \u2014 marched on the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Great Wall</span></b>. The Manchus suppressed Li\u00a0Zicheng\u2019s revolt and took power in Beijing themselves.</li>",
                "<li>The invading Manchus established the <b><span class=\"label\">Qing <b><span class=\"pg\">cheeng</span></b> dynasty</span></b> (1644\u20131911), the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">last dynasty to rule imperial China</span></b>. An important institution of the Qing dynasty was the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">banner system</span></b>, which acted as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">guaranteed welfare</span></b> system for Manchus and gave them benefits in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">imperial examination</span></b> (positions were often duplicated, with one Han Chinese and one Manchu from the banners). The foundations of the Qing dynasty were established under its second ruler, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kangxi Emperor</span></b>, who put down the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Revolt of the Three Feudatories</span></b>. He is also famous for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kangxi dictionary</span></b>, which is known for popularizing the system of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chinese radicals</span></b>. During the last century of Qing rule, China was weakened both by foreign attacks (the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Opium Wars</span></b> against <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Britain</span></b>) and internal dissent (the devastating <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Taiping Rebellion</span></b> of 1850\u20131864). Attempts to modernize Qing rule (the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Self-Strengthening Movement</span></b> and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hundred Days\u2019 Reform</span></b> of 1898) proved inconclusive. Qing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dowager Express Cixi</span></b>, who opposed the reformers, was implicated in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Boxer Rebellion</span></b>, an anti-foreign uprising of 1900 that caused eight Western nations to send military forces to Beijing. China\u2019s last emperor was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Puyi</span></b>, who came to the throne at the age of two in 1906.

Built on an island in 1829, the fort was one of three that the United States maintained in the harbor of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Charleston, South Carolina</span></b>. In order to claim true independence from the Union, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jefferson Davis</span></b> decided that the forts needed to be taken; a Confederate force under <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">P.\u00a0G.\u00a0T. Beauregard</span></b> ordered the small Union garrison, controlled by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Major Robert Anderson</span></b>, to surrender. Anderson refused, shots were fired, and the Union commander surrendered two days later with only one soldier killed. The Union made two unsuccessful attempts to recapture the fort with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ironclad ships</span></b> in 1863, but Confederate forces finally abandoned Sumter when they left Charleston in February 1865.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">First Bull Run (or First Manassas)</span></b> (July 21, 1861). Fought at a creek near Manassas, Virginia (30 miles west of Washington, D.C.), this was the first major showdown of the war. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">P.\u00a0G.\u00a0T. Beauregard</span></b> led an army against Union commander <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Irwin McDowell</span></b> and received reinforcements from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joseph Johnston</span></b>\u2019s troops (whom Union General Robert Patterson failed to detain). The Confederacy routed the Union when <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thomas Jackson</span></b>\u2019s brigade held the left line at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Henry House Hill</span></b>; this effort earned him the nickname <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cStonewall.\u201d</span></b> Congressmen and reporters, who had expected to watch a Union victory, fled in panic back to D.C.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Hampton Roads</span></b> (March 9, 1862). A channel in southeastern Virginia was the site of the first major fight between two <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ironclad ships</span></b>. The Confederates raised an old wooden boat, the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Merrimack</i>, and fit it with ten guns and iron armor plates. Renamed the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Virginia</i>, it was captained by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Franklin Buchanan</span></b>. The Union countered by constructing a large oval with a rotating gun, called the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Monitor</i> and piloted by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Worden</span></b>. The <i>Virginia</i> tore through Union wooden ships (the <i>Cumberland</i>, <i>Congress</i>, and <i>Minnesota</i>) but when the <i>Monitor</i> arrived, the two ironclads fought to a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">stalemate</span></b>; the Union thus maintained its <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">naval blockade</span></b> of the Confederacy. The South deliberately destroyed the <i>Virginia</i> two months later. The <i>Monitor</i> sank in a storm off Cape Hatteras in December 1862.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Shiloh (or Pittsburg Landing)</span></b> (April 6\u20137, 1862). This battle was named after a church in Pittsburg Landing, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tennessee</span></b> (100 miles southwest of Nashville). Confederate commander <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Albert Sidney Johnston</span></b> led a force north from Corinth, Mississippi. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ulysses S. Grant</span></b>, who had just captured Fort Donelson, brought five Union divisions to face him.

More than 13,000 Union and 10,000 Confederate soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured at Shiloh.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Peninsular Campaign</span></b> (March\u2013July 1862). Union commander <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George McClellan</span></b> devised this plan to capture the Confederate capital at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Richmond, Virginia</span></b> by sending 110,000 men up the peninsula between the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">York and James Rivers</span></b>. Advised of Northern maneuvers, Southern commander <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joseph Johnston</span></b> detached a force to defend the peninsula. He also sent a small unit (led by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stonewall Jackson</span></b>) that crushed Union reinforcements in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Shenandoah Valley</span></b>. After Johnston was wounded at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Seven Pines</span></b> (June 1), Davis replaced him with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert E. Lee</span></b>. Lee concentrated his force north of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chickahominy River</span></b>; in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Seven Days\u2019 Battles</span></b> (June 25\u00a0\u2013 July 1), the Confederates broke through Union defenses, leading to McClellan\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">retreat down the James</span></b> toward <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Harrison\u2019s Landing</span></b>, and the failure of the campaign.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Second Bull Run (or Second Manassas)</span></b> (August 29\u201330, 1862). This resounding victory by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert E.

Lee maneuvered Jackson\u2019s troops behind those of Pope; Jackson detained Pope\u2019s men at Manassas while Lee sent James Longstreet to crush Pope\u2019s left flank. Pope\u2019s and McClellan\u2019s joint forces retreated to defend Washington, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ceding all of Virginia</span></b> to the Confederacy and marking a low point in the Union effort.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Antietam (or Sharpsburg)</span></b> (September 17, 1862). The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bloodiest single day</span></b> of the Civil War: 12,000 Union and 10,000 Confederate casualties. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert E. Lee</span></b> invaded Maryland, but a Union soldier <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">discovered Lee\u2019s battle plans</span></b> wrapped around three discarded cigars. After the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Battle of South Mountain</span></b> (September 14), Lee\u2019s forces retired toward Antietam Creek. Meanwhile, Stonewall Jackson\u2019s forces captured <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Harper\u2019s Ferry, Virginia</span></b>, and rushed north to rejoin Lee\u2019s main army. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George McClellan</span></b> had a substantial numerical superiority over Lee\u2019s Confederates, but failed to effectively coordinate his army\u2019s attacks. Antietam thus was actually a series of several distinct clashes, near the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dunker Church</span></b>, along the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bloody Lane</span></b>, and around <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Burnside\u2019s Bridge</span></b>. After the battle\u2019s conclusion, Lee\u2019s battered army <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">retreated across the Potomac</span></b> into Virginia; the Union victory allowed President Lincoln to issue the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emancipation Proclamation</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Fredericksburg</span></b> (December 13, 1862). At this site, about 50 miles south of Washington, Union commander <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ambrose Burnside</span></b> (who had replaced George McClellan) tried to take the initiative and cross the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rappahannock River</span></b> in a march toward Richmond. He met Robert E. Lee\u2019s forces, which were well entrenched on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Marye\u2019s Heights</span></b> behind the town. Burnside\u2019s army took heavy losses assaulting the heights, and fell back across the Rappahannock.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Vicksburg Campaign</span></b> (April 29\u00a0\u2013 July 4, 1863). This campaign was launched by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ulysses S. Grant</span></b> to take control of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mississippi River</span></b> and cut off the western Confederate states from the east. Grant ordered forces led by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">James McPherson</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John McClernand</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">William Tecumseh Sherman</span></b> through bayous west of the Mississippi to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hard Times, Louisiana</span></b>. They were up against Confederate defenders under <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joseph Johnston</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Pemberton</span></b>. Sherman and McPherson drove Johnston from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jackson, Mississippi</span></b> on May 14, and the Union scored a victory at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Champion\u2019s Hill</span></b> two days later, but could not drive the Southerners out of Vicksburg, so Grant laid siege to the town. Outnumbered 71,000 to 20,000 and on the brink of starvation, Pemberton finally surrendered his men; Johnston withdrew east.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Chancellorsville</span></b> (May 1\u20134, 1863). A victory for the South, but with great cost, as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stonewall Jackson</span></b> lost his life. Lincoln called on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cFighting Joe\u201d Hooker</span></b> to command the Union army; Hooker took a force of 134,000 and provoked <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert E. Lee</span></b> and Jackson\u2019s 60,000 men into battle. Jackson moved around Hooker and counterattacked the Union flank on May 2. That night, while Jackson was on reconnaissance, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">his own men</span></b> mistook him for a Northerner and shot him; he died of pneumonia eight days later. The following morning, a cannonball blast hit the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chancellor House</span></b>, knocking Hooker unconscious; Union troops, led by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Sedgwick</span></b>, then retreated. Casualties for the North outnumbered those of the South, 17,000 to 13,000.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Gettysburg</span></b> (July 1\u20133, 1863). This marked both the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">farthest northward</span></b> advance by the Confederacy and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">turning point</span></b> that led to its defeat. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert E.

Low on supplies, on the third and final day Lee ordered an attack on the center; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George Pickett</span></b> led his famous <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201ccharge\u201d</span></b> through open fields, where the Union mowed down one-third of his 15,000 men. The Confederates lost 20,000 and Lee retreated to Virginia.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Chattanooga Campaign</span></b> (September\u2013November 1863). It began when Union <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">General William Rosecrans</span></b> forced Confederate commander <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Braxton Bragg</span></b> out of the city on September 9. Ten days later, at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chickamauga</span></b> (in Georgia), Bragg and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">James Longstreet</span></b> turned the tables by whipping Rosecrans, forcing him into a siege position at Chattanooga. Only <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George Thomas</span></b> (the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cRock of Chickamauga\u201d</span></b>) saved Rosecrans\u2019s army from annihilation.

By the end of the campaign, Grant\u2019s army approached the James River and Lee\u2019s army had suffered severely from a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cwar of attrition.\u201d</span></b></li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Petersburg Campaign</span></b> (June 1864\u00a0\u2013 April 1865). After Cold Harbor, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ulysses S.

The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">trenches</span></b> in which much of the fighting took place were similar to those later used in World War\u00a0I. On July 30, Pennsylvania <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">coal miners</span></b> detonated four tons of powder in a tunnel underneath the Confederate line; this <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBattle of the Crater\u201d</span></b> killed many defenders. Although the South held the city of Petersburg, its supplies ran thin in the winter of 1865. Grant finally destroyed the Confederate right flank at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Five Forks</span></b> (April 1\u20132), 14 miles southwest of Petersburg. This resounding defeat led to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert E.

On the coast of the Yucat\u00e1n, the Cort\u00e9s expedition was joined by the Spanish castaway <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ger\u00f3nimo de Aguilar</span></b> and a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nahua</span></b> captive known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cLa Malinche\u201d</span></b> or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cDo\u00f1a Marina,\u201d</span></b> who served as translators. After traveling north, Cort\u00e9s and his men defied the authority of Vel\u00e1zquez by founding the city <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Veracruz</span></b>, an act which allowed Cort\u00e9s to take legal control of the expedition. The Spanish then pressed inland, surviving an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">attempted massacre</span></b> in the city <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cholula</span></b> and making allies with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tlaxcalans</span></b>, who were traditional enemies of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aztecs</span></b>. Upon reaching the Aztec capital, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tenochtitlan</span></b>, Cort\u00e9s and his men were welcomed by the Aztec emperor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Montezuma\u00a0II</span></b>. Cort\u00e9s took Montezuma prisoner, but was forced to return to the coast to deal with a punitive expedition sent by Vel\u00e1zquez and commanded by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Panfilo de Narvaez</span></b>. Although Cort\u00e9s won the new arrivals over to his side, the situation in Tenochtitlan deteriorated as the conquistador <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pedro de Alvarado</span></b> murdered celebrants at a festival. Shortly after Cort\u00e9s returned to the city, Montezuma was killed and the Spanish were forced to flee during the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Noche Triste</span></b> (Night of Sorrows). After escaping, Cort\u00e9s marshalled Spanish and indigenous forces to fight the Aztecs, who were successively led by the emperors <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cuitlahuac</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cuauhtemoc</span></b>. After the Aztec defenders were seriously weakened by an outbreak of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">smallpox</span></b>, Cort\u00e9s and his followers captured Tenochtitlan in 1521 and rebuilt it as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mexico City</span></b>.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Miguel Hidalgo</span></b> (1753\u20131811) was a parish <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">priest</span></b> who became the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">leader of Mexico\u2019s first independence movement</span></b>. After <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula</span></b> in 1808 and ousted the Spanish king Ferdinand\u00a0VII, political movements advocating Enlightenment ideas of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">representative government</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">local self-determination</span></b> sprung up in many of Spain\u2019s American colonies. Hidalgo belonged to one such group, which officials in the viceroyalty of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">New Spain</span></b> attempted to suppress. In response, Hidalgo called his congregation together and issued a call for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">revolt</span></b> known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cGrito de Dolores,\u201d</span></b> or \u201cCry of Dolores\u201d on September\u00a016, 1810.

In 1811, Hidalgo was captured and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">executed</span></b> by the colonial regime. The leadership of the independence movement then fell to another priest named <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos</span></b>, who was himself executed in 1815.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Agust\u00edn de\u00a0Iturbide</span></b> (1783\u20131824) was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">royalist general</span></b> who changed his allegiances to become the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">first ruler of independent Mexico</span></b>. Like many <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Creoles</span></b>, or people of European descent born in the Americas, Iturbide feared that the insurgency would upset <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">colonial hierarchies of race and class</span></b>. In 1820, however, a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">liberal revolution in Spain</span></b> caused conservative Mexican elites to reconsider the benefits of independence. Iturbide reached out to the insurgent leader <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Vicente Guerrero</span></b>, and agreed to endorse <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">legal racial equality</span></b> in exchange for Guerrero\u2019s military support. Early in 1821 Iturbide released the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Plan of Iguala</span></b>, which is also known as the \u201cPlan of the Three Guarantees\u201d or \u201cPlan Trigarante\u201d because it called for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mexican independence</span></b>, a wholly <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Catholic state</span></b>, and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">equality of all races</span></b>. Iturbide\u2019s Army of the Three Guarantees soon forced <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Juan O\u2019Donoju</span></b>, the last viceroy of New Spain, to acknowledge Mexican independence in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba</span></b>.

When Iturbide returned to Mexico in 1824, he was quickly <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">executed</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna</span></b> (1794\u20131876) was a general who served as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">president of Mexico eleven different times</span></b> between 1833 and 1855. After gaining independence, many Latin American nations fell under the rule of <i class=\"ygk-term\">caudillos</i>, or charismatic leaders who exercised both <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">military and political power</span></b>. As one of these figures, Santa Anna cultivated an image of himself as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">savior</span></b> of the Mexican nation, and even held an elaborate funeral for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">leg that he lost during a conflict with France</span></b> known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cPastry War.\u201d</span></b> However, Santa Anna proved unable to prevent the loss of Mexico\u2019s northern territories. Despite routing the defenders of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Alamo</span></b>, Santa Anna was defeated by the forces of Sam Houston at the 1836 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Battle of San Jacinto</span></b>, and was forced to recognize <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Texan independence</span></b>. A little more than a decade later, Santa Anna seized control of the government during the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mexican-American War</span></b>, only to lose major battles at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cerro Gordo</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chapultepec</span></b>, and be forced into <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">exile</span></b>. He returned to Mexico in 1853 and tried to establish a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">permanent dictatorship</span></b>, but was challenged by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Liberal Plan of Ayutla</span></b>, and was driven from power in 1855.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Benito Ju\u00e1rez</span></b> (1806\u20131872) was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Liberal</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">lawyer</span></b> who became the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">first indigenous president of Mexico</span></b>, and who led the opposition to the French-backed empire of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Maximilian von\u00a0Habsburg</span></b>. Born to a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zapotec</span></b> family in the state of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Oaxaca</span></b>, Ju\u00e1rez became a key figure in the Liberal movement that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">deposed Santa Anna</span></b>, and which initiated legal and social changes known as <i class=\"ygk-term\">La Reforma</i> (\u201cthe Reform\u201d). An 1855 law named after Ju\u00e1rez sought to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">eliminate special privileges</span></b> given to members of the church and military, and was incorporated into a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">new constitution</span></b> ratified in 1857. Conservative backlash soon led to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">War of the Reform</span></b>, which lasted from 1857 to 1861, and left the victorious Liberals with little money in the national treasury. France\u2019s emperor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Napoleon\u00a0III</span></b> then used Mexico\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">foreign debts</span></b> to as a pretext for an invasion known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cFrench Intervention,\u201d</span></b> which briefly imposed the Austrian archduke <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Maximilian</span></b> as Mexico\u2019s second emperor. As the elected president of Mexico, Ju\u00e1rez <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">evaded capture</span></b> by French and imperial troops while rallying Republican forces. After the departure of the French, Liberal troops captured and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">executed</span></b> Maximilian on the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hill of the Bells</span></b> in the city of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Quer\u00e9taro</span></b>.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Porfirio D\u00edaz</span></b> (1830\u20131915) was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Liberal</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">general</span></b> who established a long-lasting <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dictatorship</span></b> that eventually led to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mexican Revolution</span></b>. In 1876 D\u00edaz issued the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Plan of Tuxtepec</span></b> and seized power from the Liberal president <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de\u00a0Tejada</span></b>. D\u00edaz then dominated Mexican politics for the next 35\u00a0years, and served as president continuously between 1884 and 1911 despite his earlier use of the slogan <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cEffective Suffrage and No Re-Election.\u201d</span></b> While in office, D\u00edaz skillfully <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">manipulated</span></b> federal, state, and local politics, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">suppressed dissent</span></b>, tamed the fractious <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mexican army</span></b>, opened Mexico to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">foreign investment</span></b>, and oversaw the beginnings of the country\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">industrial development</span></b>. His supporters praised him as a brilliant statesman who had ended the upheavals of the mid-nineteenth century; his detractors stressed the inequality, corruption, and systematic brutality of the political and economic systems fostered by D\u00edaz and his <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">positivist advisors</span></b>, who were known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cient\u00edficos</span></b>. In 1908 D\u00edaz discussed the possibility of his resignation during an interview with the American journalist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">James Creelman</span></b>, which helped open the door to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">electoral mobilization</span></b>, and eventually to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">armed rebellion</span></b>. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Anti-Reelectionist</span></b> forces of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Francisco Madero</span></b> revolted in 1910 and won their first victories in 1911, sparking uprisings elsewhere in the country. D\u00edaz promptly resigned under terms stipulated in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez</span></b>, and spent the last years of his life in comfortable <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">European exile</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Francisco Madero</span></b> (1873\u20131913) led the 1910 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">revolution against Porfirio D\u00edaz</span></b>, and served as president of Mexico from 1911 to 1913. As the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">idealistic</span></b> son of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">wealthy Coahuilan</span></b> family, Madero was in some ways an unlikely revolutionary. However, Madero\u2019s idealism allowed him to challenge D\u00edaz with a boldness that more powerful politicians and generals had lacked. After the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Creelman interview</span></b> was released, Madero wrote a book titled <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Presidential Succession in 1910</i>, which argued that it was time for D\u00edaz to be replaced, and which revived D\u00edaz\u2019s former slogan, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cEffective Suffrage and No Re-Election.\u201d</span></b> Madero then ran for president, but was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arrested</span></b> before the election. After <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">escaping from prison</span></b>, Madero issued the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed</span></b>, which called for a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">general revolt</span></b> in November 1910. Dissatisfaction with the D\u00edaz regime coalesced around Madero, who unseated the dictator and took power after democratic elections were held in the fall of 1911. However, Madero was unable to satisfy the far-reaching demands of the diverse coalition that had brought him to power. Madero was also disliked by the American ambassador <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Henry Lane Wilson</span></b> and by former supporters of the D\u00edaz regime, many of whom retained their positions in the government and army. In February 1913, Wilson encouraged General <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Victoriano Huerta</span></b> to participate in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">coup</span></b> against Madero. After a period of fighting within Mexico City that is known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Decena Tr\u00e1gica</span></b>, or Tragic Ten Days, Madero was forced to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">resign</span></b>. Huerta became president, and Madero was murdered a few days later.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Venustiano Carranza</span></b> (1859\u20131920) was the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cFirst Chief\u201d of the Constitutionalist army</span></b> during the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mexican Revolution</span></b>, and president of Mexico from 1917 to 1920. After the death of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Francisco Madero</span></b>, Carranza issued the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Plan of Guadalupe</span></b>, and became the nucleus of opposition to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Victoriano Huerta</span></b>\u2019s regime. Carranza\u2019s movement was supported by the generals <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pancho Villa</span></b>, who assembled armies in northern Mexico and pushed south to the capital. The southern general <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emiliano Zapata</span></b> also allied with Carranza to remove Huerta from power. After Huerta was forced to resign in 1914, members of Carranza\u2019s movement held a convention in the city of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aguascalientes</span></b>. The convention formed a new government that was supported by Villa and Zapata, but opposed by Gonz\u00e1lez and Obreg\u00f3n. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Constitutionalist</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Convention</span></b> forces battled until 1915, when Carranza\u2019s adherents gained the upper hand and the Convention split into separate factions, some of which continued to fight the Constitutionalists for years. Carranza went on to call for a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">new constitution</span></b>, to be based on the Liberal Constitution of 1857. The ensuing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Constitution of 1917</span></b> went far beyond the minor reforms that Carranza had envisioned, and promoted <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">land redistribution</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">workers\u2019 rights</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">anticlericalism</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">national ownership of Mexico\u2019s natural resources</span></b>. Over the next several years, Carranza proved reluctant to enact the 1917 constitution\u2019s more radical provisions, or to give up control of the government. Obreg\u00f3n forced Carranza to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">flee</span></b> the capital in 1920, and likely had a role in Carranza\u2019s subsequent <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">assassination</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Emiliano Zapata</span></b> (1879\u20131919) and <b><span class=\"label\">Pancho Villa</span></b> (born Doroteo Arango) (1878\u20131923) were both early supporters of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Francisco Madero</span></b>, opponents of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Victoriano Huerta</span></b>, and leaders of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Convention forces</span></b> during the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mexican Revolution</span></b>. Villa chiefly operated in northern Mexico, while Zapata was based in his home state, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Morelos</span></b>, south of Mexico City. In 1911 Villa and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pascual Orozco</span></b> led Maderista forces at the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Battle of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez</span></b>, while Zapata issued the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Plan of Ayala</span></b>, which called for the breakup of large <i class=\"ygk-term\">haciendas</i> and the restoration of communal lands known as <i class=\"ygk-term\">ejidos</i>. During Madero\u2019s presidency Villa was imprisoned by Victoriano Huerta, who also conducted a brutal military campaign against the peasant supporters of Zapata. After Madero\u2019s death, Villa joined Carranza\u2019s army as the leader of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Divisi\u00f3n del Norte</span></b>, or Division of the North, and Zapata established himself as the central leader of the various <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">southern guerrilla movements</span></b>. At the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Convention of Aguascalientes</span></b>, Villa\u2019s supporters sought to promote the rights of peasants and workers; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zapatistas</span></b> took a less active role at the meeting, but were willing to support the Convention government in opposition to Carranza. In the subsequent fighting, Zapatista soldiers <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">took the capital</span></b> several times but were <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unable to hold it</span></b> after 1915, the same year that Villa suffered defeats at the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">battles of Celaya</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Agua Prieta</span></b>. Zapata retreated to Morelos and carried out local <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">land reforms</span></b> as the Constitutionalists focused on defeating Villa, who sought to obtain supplies by carrying out a 1916 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">raid on the American town of Columbus, New Mexico</span></b>. In response to this incursion, the U.S. sent a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cpunitive expedition\u201d</span></b> led by General <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John J. Pershing</span></b> to (unsuccessfully) pursue Villa across northern Mexico. The influence of Villa and Zapata declined, and both were eventually <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">assassinated</span></b>. However, the two men remain symbols of the Revolution\u2019s popular aspirations. Zapata in particular has served as an inspiration to later movements such as the Chiapas-based EZLN, or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zapatista Army of National Liberation</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas</span></b> (1895\u20131970) was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">revolutionary general</span></b> who served as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">president</span></b> from 1934 to 1940, and who worked to fulfill the Constitution of 1917\u2019s promises of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">land reform</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">nationalization</span></b> of key resources. After Carranza\u2019s death, Mexico was ruled by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cSonoran dynasty\u201d</span></b> of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Plutarco El\u00edas Calles</span></b>, who stabilized the country and implemented limited reforms. Calles also founded a forerunner of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">PRI</span></b>, or Institutional Party of the Revolution, which dominated Mexican politics throughout the 20th century. After stepping down as president, Calles continued to control Mexican politics from 1928 to 1934 during a period known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cMaximato.\u201d</span></b> However, C\u00e1rdenas surprised Calles by turning against him, and forcing him into exile. As president, C\u00e1rdenas also <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">broke up large estates</span></b> into communal <i class=\"ygk-term\">ejidos</i>, promoted <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">organized labor</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">expropriated foreign-owned oil fields</span></b> in 1938 to form the national oil company <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pemex</span></b>, or Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos. These actions made C\u00e1rdenas very popular, but once he left office the Mexican government\u2019s commitment to economic redistribution soon waned. In 1988 L\u00e1zaro\u2019s son <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas</span></b> challenged PRI control of politics by running for president as the candidate of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">PRD</span></b>, or Party of the Democratic Revolution. Although <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">electoral fraud</span></b> prevented Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas from winning, his challenge helped to bring about political changes that eventually led <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Vicente Fox</span></b> of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">PAN</span></b>, or National Action Party, to be elected president in 2000.</li>"

Just before the battle, Nelson\u2019s flagship \u2014 the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">HMS <i>Victory</i></span></b> \u2014 flew the signal <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cEngland expects that every man will do his duty.\u201d</span></b> Although Nelson was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">killed by a French sniper</span></b> in the battle that followed, his ships captured half of the French fleet, including Admiral Villeneuve. French plans to invade Britain were postponed indefinitely.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Austerlitz</span></b> (December\u00a02, 1805, Czech Republic) Napoleon\u2019s Grand Army then struck east at Austria and Russia, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">land-bound members of the Third Coalition</span></b>. Napoleon\u2019s first move was to force the surrender of 30,000 Austrians under <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">General Mack</span></b> at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ulm</span></b>. The French then turned east into the heart of Austria, where they seized <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Vienna</span></b> and awaited counterattack by the Russians. At Austerlitz on December\u00a02, 1805, a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mostly-Russian coalition army</span></b> collided with the waiting French. (The Russians, led in person by Tsar <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Alexander\u00a0I</span></b>, were joined by the scattered remains of the Austrian army under Holy Roman Emperor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Francis\u00a0II</span></b>. Austerlitz is thus known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBattle of the Three Emperors.\u201d</span></b>) The allies, planning to advance their left, abandoned the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pratzen Heights</span></b>, a dominating hill in the center of the battlefield. Napoleon seized the heights, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">splitting the Russian army</span></b> and then defeating each half in turn. The resulting <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Peace of Pressburg</span></b> (December 26, 1805) ended the War of the Third Coalition and brought about the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">downfall of the Holy Roman Empire</span></b>.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Jena-Auerstedt</span></b> (October\u00a014, 1806, Germany) In 1806 Napoleon turned his forces against <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Prussia</span></b>. At the twin October battles Jena and Auerstedt, Napoleon and Marshal <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Louis-Nicolas Davout</span></b> worked together to smash a Prussian army led by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Duke of Brunswick</span></b>, who was mortally wounded by Davout\u2019s troops near Auerstadt. The collapse of the Prussian army, widely considered the continent\u2019s most experienced and professional military force, shocked European observers. Napoleon felt that he had secured revenge for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Frederick the Great</span></b>\u2019s victory over France at Rossbach in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Seven Years\u2019 War</span></b> (1757).</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Salamanca</span></b> (July\u00a022, 1812, Spain) While Napoleon struggled against Austrians, Russians, and Prussians on the plains of central and eastern Europe, a smaller but no less violent conflict was fought for control of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Spain</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Portugal</span></b>. During this <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cPeninsular War\u201d</span></b> (1807\u20131814), the throne of Spain was claimed by Napoleon\u2019s older brother, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joseph Bonaparte</span></b>. Spanish and Portuguese resistance (the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">first \u201cguerrilla\u201d warfare</span></b>, from the Spanish for \u201clittle war\u201d) was supported by the landing of British troops under the command of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Duke of Wellington</span></b>. Wellington\u2019s triumph over Marshal <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Auguste Marmont</span></b> at Salamanca in July\u00a01812 was a decisive blow against the stability of Joseph\u2019s regime.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Borodino</span></b> (September\u00a07, 1812, Russia) In 1812 Napoleon assembled the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">largest army of his reign</span></b> for the most ambitious military operation of the 19th century: a full-scale <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">invasion of Russia</span></b>. Russian Tsar <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Alexander\u00a0I</span></b>, despite losing to Napoleon in central Europe between 1805 and 1807, refused to agree to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cContinental System,\u201d</span></b> the Napoleonic proposal for a Europe-wide <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">embargo on British trade in manufactured goods</span></b>. Napoleon\u2019s march on Moscow was slowed by Russian resistance at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Borodino</span></b>, where Marshal <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mikhail Kutuzov</span></b>\u2019s army was driven out of fortified redoubts after a day of destructive fighting. Although French forces were briefly able to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">seize control of Moscow</span></b>, the subsequent retreat through the worst of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Russian winter</span></b> ruined Napoleon\u2019s Grand Army.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Leipzig</span></b> (October\u00a016\u201319, 1813, Germany) The following year the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Russian army</span></b> marched west into central Europe at the head of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cSixth Coalition\u201d</span></b> that brought the previously defeated <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Austrians</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Prussians</span></b> back into hostilities against France. At Leipzig in central Germany, coalition forces met a hastily-assembled replacement army raised by Napoleon after the disaster in Russia. More than 600,000 men fought in this four-day struggle, popularly known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cBattle of the Nations\u201d</span></b> for the multi-ethnic nature of the coalition army. The forces of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Saxony</span></b>, one of the minor German states, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">switched sides</span></b> during the Battle of Leipzig, leaving Napoleon\u2019s army to join the allies. The premature <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">destruction of a bridge over the River Elster</span></b> hindered Napoleon\u2019s retreat from Leipzig, the first in a series of military disasters that led to the emperor\u2019s forced <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">abdication</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">exile</span></b> to the Mediterranean island Elba in 1814.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Waterloo</span></b> (June\u00a018, 1815, Belgium) Napoleon\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">escape from Elba</span></b> began a period known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cHundred Days,\u201d</span></b> in which the emperor briefly returned to the throne of France. The struggle between the restored emperor and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cSeventh Coalition\u201d</span></b> began when Napoleon\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Army of the North</span></b> marched into the Low Countries, hoping for a showdown with the British, Dutch, and Prussians before the Austrian and Russian armies gathering further east could come to their aid. The French brushed aside Allied advance guards at the two preliminary battles <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Quatre Bras</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ligny</span></b> on June\u00a016. Napoleon\u2019s victory over the Prussians at Ligny led him to falsely believe that he had enough time to pursue and defeat the British without further <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Prussian interference</span></b>. On June\u00a018 Napoleon\u2019s advance on Brussels approached the crossroads of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mont St.\u00a0Jean</span></b>, where the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Duke of Wellington</span></b> had set up a defensive position for a combined army of British <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Peninsular War veterans</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dutch</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pro-British Germans</span></b>. On the French left, British troops defended the walled farm <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hougoumont</span></b> from a series of infantry assaults; in the center, Marshal <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Michel Ney</span></b>\u2019s massed cavalry charge was broken by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">square formations</span></b> of the British infantry; on the right, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Gebhard von\u00a0Bl\u00fccher</span></b>\u2019s Prussian army arrived to attack the French army in the flank. Napoleon\u2019s final gamble was to commit his <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Imperial Guard</span></b> to a renewed assault on the Allied center. The guardsmen were cut down by the fire of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">British light infantry</span></b>, leading to the general <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">collapse of the French army</span></b>. Napoleon was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">exiled</span></b> once more, this time to the isolated South Atlantic island <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">St.\u00a0Helena</span></b>, where he died in 1821.</li>\n</ul>",

The confederacy gradually expanded to control much of the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic regions and also incorporated the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tuscarora</span></b> people, who migrated from North Carolina after defeat in a colonial war. In the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Beaver Wars</span></b>, the Iroquois and their British allies came to dominate various <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Algonquin</span></b> peoples allied with the French.

The close association between the Franks and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">papacy</span></b> benefited both parties in an age when their mutual enemies (such as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Visigoths</span></b>) were either heretics or still pagan. Merovingian Gaul was wracked by civil war among contending Frankish kings; by the beginning of the 8th century the Merovingians had lost effective power to their chief ministers, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cmayors of the palace.\u201d</span></b> In 751 mayor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pepin the Short</span></b>, with permission from the pope, deposed the last Merovingian and established a new <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Carolingian dynasty</span></b> of Frankish kings. Pepin\u2019s son was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Charlemagne</span></b>, who subjugated much of western Europe and presided over a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">revival of learning</span></b> known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cCarolingian Renaissance.\u201d</span></b> On Christmas Day 800 Charlemagne was crowned <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">emperor</span></b> in Rome. Charlemagne\u2019s grandsons quarreled over rights to his inheritance, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">splitting the Frankish empire</span></b> into a cluster of regional domains. The westernmost (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cWest Francia\u201d</span></b>) became the kingdom of France; the eastern one beyond the Rhine (\u201cEast Francia\u201d) retained the imperial title as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Holy Roman Empire</span></b>.</li>\n<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Picts</span></b>, the early medieval inhabitants of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">northern Britain</span></b>, were known for their <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">raids</span></b> on the Roman frontier fortification <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hadrian\u2019s Wall</span></b>. Their name (from the Latin <i>pictus</i>, \u201cpainted\u201d) may refer to their use of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">colorful tattoos</span></b>. Pictish art is notable for elaborate <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">stone carvings</span></b> of mysterious beasts. Starting in the 9th century, the Pictish kingdoms were absorbed by the neighboring kingdom of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Scots</span></b>.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">\u201cAnglo-Saxons\u201d</span></b> is the conventional designation for a group of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Germanic peoples</span></b> (primarily Angles, Saxons, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jutes</span></b>) who migrated from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">northwestern Europe</span></b> (the North Sea coast of Germany and mainland Denmark) to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Britain</span></b> in the 5th and 6th centuries.  The Anglo-Saxon settlers <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">conquered</span></b> or displaced the Roman and British inhabitants of the island (the semilegendary <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">King Arthur</span></b> is portrayed as a British ruler fighting against Saxon expansion). By the early 7th century, seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms across southern and eastern Britain were known collectively as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Heptarchy</span></b> (a group of seven rulers). <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Christian missionaries</span></b> arrived from Italy and Ireland to convert the pagan Anglo-Saxons. Cultural products of the newly Christian kingdoms included <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">illuminated manuscripts</span></b>; the writings of the monastic historian the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Venerable Bede</span></b>, and the epic poem <i class=\"ygk-term\">Beowulf</i>. The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were hard-hit by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Viking raids</span></b> of the 9th century; only <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Wessex</span></b>, the southwesternmost kingdom, survived and repelled the Scandinavian raiders. The kings of Wessex then <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unified the Anglo-Saxon territories as a single kingdom of England</span></b>.</li>\n<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Magyars</span></b>, like the Huns, were a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">nomadic people of central Asia</span></b>. Their language is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ugric</span></b>, related to Finnish and a number of west Siberian languages. Magyars occupied the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Danube basin</span></b> shortly before 900.

According to the historian <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thucydides</span></b>, the disease spread to Athens from Ethiopia and killed up to 25% of the city\u2019s population, including its leading statesman, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pericles</span></b>. Though the illness spread to other cities, its particular impact on Athens helped <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sparta</span></b> become the foremost city in Greece. The cause of the plague remains unknown; historians have speculated that it may have been <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">typhus</span></b> or an unknown type of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">hemorrhagic fever</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Antonine Plague</span></b> spread across the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Roman Empire</span></b> from AD\u00a0165 to 180. Roman troops brought the disease into the Mediterranean world after returning from war against <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Parthia</span></b> in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mesopotamia</span></b>. The outbreak is named for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Antonine dynasty</span></b>, which ruled Rome at the time under co-emperors <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Marcus Aurelius</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lucius Verus</span></b> (the latter of whom likely died of the plague); the dynasty\u2019s founder, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Antoninus Pius</span></b>, had died in AD\u00a0161. The physician <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Galen</span></b> wrote detailed accounts of the outbreak, which allowed modern scholars to determine that the plague was likely either <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">smallpox</span></b> or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">measles</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Plague of Justinian</span></b> is a common name for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">first plague pandemic</span></b> that swept Europe and Asia beginning during the 540s. The plague struck <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Constantinople</span></b> during the reign of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Justinian\u00a0I</span></b>, who was attempting to reassert Roman control over the Mediterranean. It was caused by the bacterium <i class=\"ygk-term\">Yersinia pestis</i>, the same agent that later caused the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Black Death</span></b>. The plague and its many recurrences devastated <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Byzantium</span></b> and neighboring countries like the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sassanid Empire</span></b>; their weakened states helped enable the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Muslim conquests</span></b> in the 7th century.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Black Death</span></b> is a common name for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">second plague pandemic</span></b> which spread in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mid-14th century</span></b>. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mongol</span></b> forces likely introduced the plague to Europe while besieging the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Genoese colony of Kaffa</span></b> in Crimea. Over the following decade, the disease killed roughly half of the continent\u2019s population. It also sparked major social disruptions, including <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">peasant revolts</span></b> in England and France and mass <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">anti-semitism</span></b>, due to many blaming the plague on Jews. The frame story for Giovanni Boccaccio\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Decameron</i> involves ten people fleeing the plague in Florence. Scattered plague outbreaks continued across Europe for the next 300 years, including the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Great Plague of London</span></b> in 1665. It is likely the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">deadliest</span></b> pandemic ever.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Syphilis</span></b>, a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sexually transmitted disease</span></b>, spread across Europe beginning in the 1490s. While its origins are disputed, many Renaissance and contemporary scholars believe it came to Europe <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">from the Americas</span></b> after Christopher Columbus\u2019s voyages. It was first described among <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">French troops invading Naples</span></b> in 1495 and known then as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cgreat pox.\u201d</span></b> Syphilis remained a major public health threat in the western world until the introduction of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">penicillin</span></b> in the 1940s. In the 20th century, the U.S. government conducted a study in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tuskegee, Alabama</span></b> that involved intentionally and inhumanely not treating hundreds of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Black men</span></b> infected with the disease.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Typhus</span></b>, an infectious fever carried by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">lice</span></b>, spread across Europe in the late 1400s. While it may have been responsible for ancient pandemics, typhus was first conclusively identified among <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Spanish troops</span></b> attacking Granada near the end of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Reconquista</span></b> (15th century). Later typhus epidemics often coincided with military conflicts, for instance, causing most of the deaths during the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thirty Years\u2019 War</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Russia</span></b>. Typhus killed many victims of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Holocaust</span></b>, including <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Anne Frank</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Smallpox</span></b>, a disease caused by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">variola</span></b> virus, circulated as early as 1500\u00a0BC. While the disease became <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">endemic</span></b> across Europe and Asia, it caused devastation when introduced to new populations. Smallpox came to the Americas through <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Spanish conquistadors</span></b>, causing millions of deaths among indigenous civilizations like the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aztecs</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Incas</span></b>. Later colonial efforts caused the disease to reach and decimate <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aboriginal Australians</span></b> and other native peoples. Chinese doctors developed strategies for inoculating against smallpox in the 1500s, while <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Edward Jenner</span></b> created the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">first ever vaccine</span></b> to prevent it in 1796 using the similar <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cowpox</span></b> virus. A successful 20th-century campaign by the World Health organization led to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">eradication</span></b> of smallpox in 1980. </li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Cholera</span></b> is an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">intestinal</span></b> infection that originated in India. Largely as a consequence of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">British colonialism</span></b>, cholera swept the globe during six pandemics in the 19th century. In the U.S. the disease killed former president James Polk and caused many deaths along the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Oregon Trail</span></b>. While studying cholera in London, epidemiologist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Snow</span></b> recognized the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Broad Street pump</span></b> as the common link in an outbreak and concluded that the disease was water-borne. Though now less fatal due to available treatments, cholera persists in large parts of the world; it killed over 10,000 people during a 2010s outbreak in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Haiti</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Spanish Flu pandemic</span></b> killed up to 100 million people from 1918 to 1920. Caused by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">H1N1</span></b> strain of influenza, the disease was first documented in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">U.S. army camp in Kansas</span></b>. It acquired its misleading name because Spain was one of the few countries not to censor information about it amid <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">World War\u00a0I</span></b>, a conflict that drove the disease\u2019s spread. Because Spanish flu often caused <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cytokine storms</span></b> in its victims, it disproportionately affected younger people. Notable victims of the pandemic included <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Gustav Klimt</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Max Weber</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">AIDS</span></b>, a condition caused by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">HIV</span></b> (the human immunodeficiency virus), triggered a pandemic beginning in 1981. Originating in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">monkeys</span></b>, the virus jumped to humans in the early 20th century but did not spread widely until decades later. It is primarily <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sexually transmitted</span></b> and devastated <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gay communities</span></b> across the world in the 1980s and \u201990s, largely due to intentional government inaction. The AIDS epidemic has also devastated <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sub-Saharan Africa</span></b>; a 2013 study estimated that nearly 80% of all people currently living with HIV were from southern Africa. Gay journalist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Randy Shilts</span></b> chronicled the early pandemic and government indifference in his book <i class=\"ygk-term\">And the Band Played On</i>; he later died of AIDS himself. Public awareness of HIV/AIDS increased as it killed celebrities like <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rock Hudson</span></b>. The introduction of the drug <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">AZT</span></b> in 1987, later accompanied by other drugs, slowly helped reduce the disease\u2019s mortality rate from nearly 100%. The pandemic spurred many works of art and literature, including the play <i class=\"ygk-term\">Angels in America</i> and the massive <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">AIDS Memorial Quilt</span></b>.</li>"

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The first inauguration of Barack Obama</span></b> (2009) set a record for in-person attendance at any presidential inauguration. The swearing-in of Obama did not go smoothly: Chief Justice <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Roberts</span></b> made a mistake in the words of the oath of office, and Obama accidentally spoke over him at one point. Roberts re-administered the oath of office to Obama the next day. Obama\u2019s address was widely viewed as a sharp rebuke of George W.

Biden\u2019s inauguration had extremely limited in-person attendance due to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">COVID-19 pandemic</span></b>; a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cfield of flags\u201d</span></b> was set up on the National Mall in lieu of spectators.

Reagan\u2019s inauguration coincided with the release of the 52 Americans who were held for 444 days during the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Iran hostage crisis</span></b>. In his address, Reagan noted that while in U.S. history, the \u201corderly transfer of authority\u201d in an inauguration was \u201ca commonplace occurrence,\u201d that \u201c[i]n the eyes of many in the world, this every-4-year ceremony we accept as normal is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">nothing less than a miracle</span></b>.\u201d Reagan\u2019s address ended by describing the diary of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Martin Treptow</span></b>, an American soldier who was killed during World War I.

The swearing-in of Obama did not go smoothly: Chief Justice <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Roberts</span></b> made a mistake in the words of the oath of office, and Obama accidentally spoke over him at one point. Roberts re-administered the oath of office to Obama the next day. Obama\u2019s address was widely viewed as a sharp rebuke of George W. Bush; in his speech, Obama noted <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cwe reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.\u201d</span></b> The ceremony featured a performance of the quartet \u201cAir and Simple Gifts,\u201d by film composer John Williams, which was actually mimed to an earlier taped recording, as there were concerns about the instruments remaining in tune on the cold January day.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">The inauguration of Donald Trump</span></b> (2017) aroused a great deal of controversy due to the Trump administration\u2019s claims about attendance numbers.

After the Democratic\u2013Republican Party fractured before the election, four men ran for president: Adams, General <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Andrew Jackson</span></b>, Speaker of the House <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Henry Clay</span></b>, and Treasury Secretary <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">William Crawford</span></b>. Jackson won a plurality of the popular vote and the Electoral College, but not enough to clinch victory. As a result, the House of Representatives selected among the top three candidates and gave the White House to Adams. Jackson attributed the result to a \u201ccorrupt bargain\u201d in which Clay used his influence in the House to boost Adams in exchange for being named <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Secretary of State</span></b>. Most historians believe that Clay backed Adams because they shared similar views, but Jackson used the issue to unseat Adams in 1832 and win reelection against Clay in 1836. The controversy foreshadowed later battles between Jackson\u2019s Democratic Party and Clay\u2019s Whig Party.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Petticoat Affair</span></b> (1829\u20131831) disrupted the cabinet of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Andrew Jackson</span></b>. Secretary of War <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Eaton</span></b>\u2019s wife <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Peggy</span></b> was unpopular with the wives of Jackson\u2019s other cabinet members, who thought she was immoral and too assertive for a woman. Led by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Floride Calhoun</span></b>, the wife of Vice President John C. Calhoun, they snubbed her socially and caused an obvious rift in the Jackson administration. The only cabinet member to support the Eatons was Secretary of State <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Martin Van Buren</span></b>, who was a widower. Jackson, whose own wife Rachel had died after being targeted by negative rumors while he ran for president, supported Eaton and forced his cabinet to resign. After the scandal, Van Buren became Jackson\u2019s heir apparent and eventual successor in the White House, while Calhoun became the president\u2019s staunch enemy.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Impeachment of Andrew Johnson</span></b> (1868) was the first time a president was impeached. Johnson took office after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. As a former southern Democrat and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">opponent of civil rights</span></b> for African\u2013Americans, Johnson infuriated Republicans by blocking their Reconstruction policies. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Radical Republicans</span></b> responded by passing the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tenure of Office Act</span></b>, which required the Senate to approve all changes to the cabinet. When Johnson violated the act by trying to remove Secretary of War <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Edwin Stanton</span></b>, the House impeached him in March 1868. After a trial in the Senate, only 35 of the necessary 36 senators voted to remove Johnson, with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Edmund Ross</span></b> and nine other Republicans breaking ranks to keep him in office. Though briefly thwarted, \u201cRadical Reconstruction\u201d regained momentum when Ulysses Grant was elected president later in the year.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Whiskey Ring</span></b> (1871\u20131876) scandal tarnished the presidency of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ulysses Grant</span></b>. During the 1870s, whiskey distillers, primarily in St.\u00a0Louis, set up a conspiracy to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bribe U.S. Treasury officials</span></b> to evade taxes. The \u201cring\u201d was coordinated by General <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John McDonald</span></b>, a federal revenue collector, and backed by Grant\u2019s private secretary <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Orville Babcock</span></b>. In 1875 the reform-minded Treasury Secretary <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Benjamin Bristow</span></b> exposed the conspiracy and helped secure the convictions of over 100 people. The Whiskey Ring, alongside other controversies like the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Star Route scandal</span></b>, tarnished Grant\u2019s reputation, though historians are unsure about how much the president knew about corruption around him.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Pinchot\u2013Ballinger Affair</span></b> (1909\u20131910) split the Republican Party over <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">conservation issues</span></b> during the presidency of William Howard Taft. After succeeding his friend Theodore Roosevelt as president, Taft controversially appointed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Richard Ballinger</span></b> as Secretary of the Interior. The appointment was seen as a reversal of Roosevelt\u2019s progressive conservation policies. In office, Ballinger began returning private lands to private use and clashed with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Louis Glavis</span></b> of the General Land Office and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Gifford Pinchot</span></b>, the head of the U.S. Forest Service. When Glavis and Pinchot accused Ballinger of corruption, Taft fired them. Although an investigation cleared Ballinger of wrongdoing, the scandal led Roosevelt to break from Taft and run for president with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Progressive Party</span></b> in 1912, which enabled Democrat Woodrow Wilson to win the White House.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Teapot Dome scandal</span></b> (1921\u20131929) was a major controversy during the presidency of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Warren G. Harding</span></b> and was considered the most damaging presidential scandal ever to that point. Harding\u2019s Secretary of the Interior, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Albert Fall</span></b>, leased Navy <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">oil reserves</span></b> at Teapot Dome, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Wyoming</span></b> to private companies at low rates. The leasing of the reserves was not illegal, but allegations arose that Fall had taken bribes from oil tycoons like <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Edward Doheny</span></b>. A long-running investigation by Senator <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thomas Walsh</span></b> uncovered proof of Fall\u2019s corruption, and in 1929, he became the first former cabinet member to go to prison. During the scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in <i class=\"ygk-term\">McGrain v. Daugherty</i> that Congress could <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">compel testimony</span></b> by issuing subpoenas.  The full extent of the scandal was not revealed until well after Harding\u2019s sudden death in office in 1923.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Watergate scandal</span></b> (1972\u20131974) became the biggest presidential scandal of all time by forcing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Richard Nixon</span></b> to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">resign</span></b> as president. During the 1972 election, burglars were caught <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">breaking into Democratic headquarters</span></b> at the Watergate building in D.C. <i class=\"ygk-term\">Washington Post</i> reporters <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bob Woodward</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Carl Bernstein</span></b> investigated the case, receiving tips from an anonymous source called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cDeep Throat\u201d</span></b> (later revealed to be deputy FBI director <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mark Felt</span></b>).  The reporters linked the break-in to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Committee for the Re-Election of the President</span></b> (CREEP). Sam Ervin led televised Senate hearings on the scandal while <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Archibald Cox</span></b> investigated as a special prosecutor. Nixon fired Cox in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Saturday Night Massacre</span></b> and tried to hide incriminating <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">recordings</span></b> that showed his role in a cover-up. When the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Supreme Court</span></b> ordered the recordings to be released, Nixon resigned before he could be impeached. He was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pardoned</span></b> by his successor Gerald Ford in 1974. Watergate caused a lasting drop in public trust in government, and the suffix \u201c-gate\u201d is often used to name major scandals in the U.S. and abroad.</li>",

However, Congress had prohibited sending aid through the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Boland Amendment</span></b>. To circumvent that restriction, Reagan officials secretly sold arms to Iran as part of a deal to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">free hostages</span></b> in Lebanon and diverted some of the proceeds to the Contras. The effort was overseen by Lieutenant Colonel <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Oliver North</span></b> of the National Security Council. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tower Commission</span></b> and independent counsel <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lawrence Walsh</span></b> investigated the scandal, indicting North and officials like Defense Secretary <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Caspar Weinberger</span></b>.

In 1995 Clinton began an affair with Lewinsky, a 19-year-old White House <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">intern</span></b>. Lewinsky\u2019s friend <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Linda Tripp</span></b> revealed the affair to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kenneth Starr</span></b>, the special prosecutor investigating Clinton\u2019s controversial <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Whitewater</span></b> land deal. Clinton had denied the affair publicly and to a grand jury, leading Starr to accuse him of perjury. The House of Representatives, led by Republican <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Newt Gingrich</span></b>, impeached Clinton in 1998, but the Senate did not come close to removing him from office. However, Clinton was fined for contempt of court and briefly lost his law license.</li>",

Soon after Wilson wrote an op-ed disputing that Hussein was trying to buy uranium, journalist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert Novak</span></b> wrote a column about Wilson that identified Plame as a CIA agent. Critics claimed that the Bush administration had leaked Plame\u2019s identity as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">payback</span></b> for Wilson\u2019s article.

                "<li><i class=\"label\">Plessy v. Ferguson</i> (Henry B.

He sat in the whites-only car in violation of an 1890 Louisiana law mandating <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">separate accommodations</span></b>.  He was convicted, but appealed to the Supreme Court against John Ferguson, a Louisiana judge.  The court upheld the law provided that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cseparate but equal\u201d</span></b> facilities were provided.  John Marshall Harlan issued a famous dissent claiming <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cOur constitution is color-blind.\u201d</span></b> <i>Plessy</i> was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">overturned by <i>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas</i></span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Marbury v. Madison</i> (John Marshall, 4\u20130, 1803): On his final day in office in 1801, John Adams signed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">commissions for 42 federal judges</span></b> (the so-called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cmidnight judges\u201d</span></b>).  His successor, Thomas Jefferson, opted to not deliver most of the commissions.  One appointee, William Marbury, sued the new secretary of state, James Madison, to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">force the delivery of his commission</span></b>.  The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Judiciary Act of 1789</span></b> had granted the court original jurisdiction in such cases, but the Constitution did not.  The court ruled that the Judiciary Act <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">conflicted with the Constitution and was therefore void</span></b>.  Therefore Marbury\u2019s request was denied for lack of jurisdiction.  This case established the principle of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">judicial review</span></b>, the power of the court to nullify unconstitutional laws.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Roe v. Wade</i> (Harry Blackmun, Warren Burger, 7\u20132, 1973): Norma McCorvey (under the alias Jane Roe), a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">rape victim</span></b>, sued Dallas County attorney Henry Wade for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">right to an abortion</span></b>.  When the case reached the Supreme Court, the plaintiff depended on the growing recognition of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cright to privacy,\u201d</span></b> which began with the 1965 case <i class=\"ygk-term\">Griswold v. Connecticut</i>.  The court <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">struck down state anti-abortion laws as \u201cunconstitutionally vague,\u201d</span></b> held that the word \u201cperson\u201d in the Constitution \u201cdoes not include the unborn,\u201d and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">legalized abortion in the first trimester</span></b>.  McCorvey later joined the pro-life movement and claimed that she was not actually raped and that she was pressured into filing the case by her ambitious attorney Sarah Weddington.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas</i> (Earl Warren, 9\u20130, 1954): The suit was filed on behalf of Linda Brown, a third grader, who had to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">walk a mile to a blacks-only school when a whites-only school was much closer</span></b>.  Future Supreme Court Justice <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thurgood Marshall</span></b> argued the case for the plaintiff.  The court <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">overturned <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i></span></b> and ruled that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cseparate but equal\u201d facilities were not constitutional</span></b>.  A second case in 1955 required that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">desegregation proceed \u201cwith all deliberate speed\u201d</span></b> but Southern schools were notoriously slow in complying; it was not until 1970 that a majority had complied with the ruling.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">McCulloch v. Maryland</i> (John Marshall, 9\u20130, 1819): After the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Second Bank of the United States</span></b> began calling in loans owed by the states, Maryland passed a law <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">taxing out-of-state banks</span></b>.  The federal bank refused to pay, so the state sued its Baltimore cashier, James McCulloch.  The court ruled that the federal government had the right to establish the bank even though it was not expressly enumerated in the Constitution and also noted that since <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cthe power to tax was the power to destroy,\u201d</span></b> Maryland could not tax the bank without destroying federal sovereignty.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Baker v. Carr</i> (William J. Brennan Jr., Earl Warren, 6\u20132, 1962): Charles W. Baker, a Tennessee citizen, sued the Tennessee secretary of state, Joe Carr, claiming that the state\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">electoral districts had been drawn to grossly favor one political party</span></b>.  The defendant argued that reapportionment issues were political, not judicial, matters, but the court disagreed and declared the issue justiciable before remanding the case to a lower court.  Two years later, in <i class=\"ygk-term\">Reynolds v. Sims</i>, the court mandated the principle of \u201cone man, one vote.\u201d</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Gideon v. Wainwright</i> (Hugo Black, Earl Warren, 9\u20130, 1963): Clarence Earl Gideon was accused of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">breaking into a pool hall</span></b> in Florida.  Because his crime was not capital, the court declined to provide him with an attorney.  He was convicted, sued Louie Wainwright \u2014 the director of the corrections office \u2014 and took his case to the Supreme Court.  The court overruled <i class=\"ygk-term\">Betts v. Brady</i> and held that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments required <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">appointed counsel in all trials</span></b>.  Gideon was retried and found innocent.  The case is the subject of the book <i>Gideon\u2019s Trumpet</i>.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Hammer v. Dagenhart</i> (William R. Day, Edward Douglass White, 5\u20134, 1918): The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Keating-Owen Act</span></b> prohibited the interstate sale of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">goods produced by child labor</span></b>, leading Roland Dagenhart to sue U.S. attorney W.\u00a0C. Hammer in Charlotte since his two sons would be put out of work.  The court ruled that the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">federal government did not have the right to regulate child labor</span></b>; Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a notable dissent focusing on the lack of proper state regulation.  The case was overturned by the 1941 case <i class=\"ygk-term\">U.S. v. Darby Lumber Company</i> case upholding the Fair Labor Standards Act.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Fletcher v. Peck</i> (John Marshall, 6\u20130, 1810): In 1795 the Georgia legislature <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">corruptly sold land along the Yazoo River</span></b> (now in Mississippi) to private citizens in exchange for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bribes</span></b>.  The legislators were mostly defeated in the next elections and the incoming politicians voided the sales.  In the meantime, John Peck sold some of the land in question to Robert Fletcher, who then sued him, claiming that he did not have clear title.

                "<li><i class=\"label\">Chisholm v. Georgia</i> (No majority opinion, Chief Justice John Jay, 4\u20131, 1793) Following the death of Robert Farquhar, his estate\u2019s executor, Alexander Chisholm \u2014 who, like Farquhar, was a South Carolina resident \u2014 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sued the state of Georgia to collect money Georgia owed</span></b> Farquhar for goods it purchased during the American Revolution. Georgia claimed that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sovereign immunity</span></b> protected it from Chisholm\u2019s suit. However, the Supreme Court held that Article\u00a0III, Section\u00a02 of the Constitution gave citizens the right to sue a state, finding against Georgia. The Court\u2019s ruling proved so controversial that it resulted in the 1794 passage of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eleventh Amendment</span></b>, which specifically prohibited U.S. or foreign citizens from filing a lawsuit against a state (with certain exceptions).</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Gibbons v. Ogden</i> (John Marshall, 6\u20130, 1824) Thomas Gibbons and Aaron Ogden were partners in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">steamboat</span></b> business that ferried people between New York and New Jersey. Ogden had purchased a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">license granting him a monopoly</span></b> under New York law. After the partners suffered a disagreement and split up, Gibbons applied for and received a federal permit to run a similar business. Ogden sued Gibbons for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">violating Ogden\u2019s monopoly</span></b>. In a unanimous decision, Marshall held that Congress\u2019 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">interstate regulatory power</span></b> under the Commerce Clause had \u201cno limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution.\u201d Gibbons\u2019 federal permit trumped Ogden\u2019s state-granted monopoly.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Dred Scott v. Sandford</i> (Roger Taney, 7\u20132, 1857) Dred Scott was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">slave</span></b> purchased by John Emerson in the 1820s, and who at various points lived in Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory, both of which prohibited slavery. In 1853, Scott sued his then-owner John Sanford for his freedom. The Supreme Court ruled that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">no African-American \u2014 slave or free \u2014 was a citizen</span></b> of the United States, and that therefore Scott <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">lacked standing to initiate a lawsuit</span></b> in the first place. In addition, the Court <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">found the Missouri Compromise to be unconstitutional</span></b>, holding that Congress lacked authority to prohibit slavery in any new territory that was not originally part of the United States.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Munn v. Illinois</i> (Morrison Waite, 7\u20132, 1877) Ira Munn owned a set of Chicago <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">grain elevators</span></b> and charged oppressively high fees for their use. In 1871, the Illinois legislature passed a law setting <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">maximum rates for grain storage</span></b>. On appeal to the Supreme Court, lawyers for the business claimed that the Illinois statute violated Fourteenth-Amendment <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">due process rights regarding private property</span></b>. Chief Justice Waite\u2019s opinion upheld the Illinois law, and proclaimed that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cwhen private property is devoted to a public use, it is subject to public regulation.\u201d</span></b> The decision was a landmark in the history of government regulation of businesses, especially railroads.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Muller v. Oregon</i> (David Brewer, Melville Fuller, 9\u20130, 1908) Oregon <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">laundry</span></b> owner Curt Muller was fined for violating an Oregon law that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">limited the working hours of female employees</span></b>; he appealed, claiming the law was an unconstitutional <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">restriction of freedom of contract</span></b>. Arguing on behalf of Oregon, future Supreme Court Justice <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Louis Brandeis</span></b> invoked scientific evidence to support the notion that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">excessive working hours were deleterious to a woman\u2019s health</span></b>. Oregon\u2019s statute was upheld on the grounds that the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">state had a compelling interest in protecting the health of its female workers</span></b>. One side effect of the decision was the judicial justification of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sex discrimination in legislation</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Schenck v. United States</i> (Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Chief Justice Edward White, 9\u20130, 1919) The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Espionage Act of 1917</span></b> prohibited \u2014 among other things \u2014 any attempt to inhibit recruitment by the U.S. Armed Forces. Charles Schenck was a Socialist who opposed conscription and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">distributed literature urging readers to resist the draft</span></b>. Follwing his arrest and conviction, he appealed, claiming that his advocacy was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">protected speech</span></b> covered by the First Amendment. Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Holmes claimed the First Amendment does not protect speech that creates a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cclear and present danger,\u201d</span></b> and that \u201cthe most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">falsely shouting \u2018fire\u2019 in a theatre</span></b>.\u201d</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Griswold v. Connecticut</i> (William O. Douglas, Earl Warren, 7\u20132, 1965) In 1879, Connecticut outlawed the use of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">contraception</span></b>. In 1961, Estelle Griswold and Lee Buxton, who were directors of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut, were charged with violating that ban after they opened a birth control clinic. Justice Douglas\u2019 majority opinion held that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cspecific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras,\u201d</span></b> and that \u201cemanations\u201d of those guarantees create a Constitutional <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">right to privacy</span></b> that protects intensely personal decisions, such as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">right of married couples to choose whether to use birth control</span></b>. Connecticut\u2019s law was struck down.</li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Miranda v. Arizona</i> (Earl Warren, 5\u20134, 1966) In 1963, Phoenix police arrested Ernesto Miranda on suspicion of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">kidnapping and rape</span></b>; he subsequently confessed to those crimes. During his initial interrogation by police, Miranda was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">never informed of his Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights</span></b>. Writing for a thin majority, Chief Justice Warren stated that \u201c[p]rior to any questioning, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">[a] person must be warned</span></b> that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed,\u201d laying the groundwork for the iconic <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cMiranda warnings.\u201d</span></b></li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Loving v. Virginia</i> (Earl Warren, 9\u20130, 1967) Virginia\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Racial Integrity Act</span></b> of 1924 was an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">anti-miscegenation</span></b> law that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">criminalized marriages between whites and non-whites</span></b>. In 1958, Virginia residents Richard Loving (a white man) and Mildred Jeter (a woman of both African-American and Native American heritage) were married in Washington, D.C., which did not have such a statute. After returning to their Virginia home, they were arrested and convicted under the Racial Integrity Act. Striking down that Act as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">violating both the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses</span></b> of the Fourteenth Amendment, Chief Justice Warren wrote that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cthe freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.\u201d</span></b></li>",
                "<li><i class=\"label\">Lawrence v. Texas</i> (Anthony Kennedy, William Rehnquist, 6\u20133, 2003) In 1998, a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">false police report</span></b> led Houston police to the apartment of John Lawrence; upon entering, deputies claimed they found Lawrence <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">having sex with another man</span></b>, Tyron Gardner. Both men were charged with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">homosexual conduct, still a misdemeanor in Texas</span></b>. Justice Kennedy\u2019s majority opinion held that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause protected a person\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cliberty\u201d to engage in consensual homosexual activity</span></b>, and declared the Texas law <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unconstitutional</span></b>. The decision in Lawrence overturned <i class=\"ygk-term\">Bowers v. Hardwick</i> (1986) \u2014 in which the court upheld a similar Georgia law \u2014 and has been cited as a key predecessor of both <i class=\"ygk-term\">U.S. v.

Dred Scott was a slave who had been taken to Illinois and free parts of the Louisiana Territory before being brought back to Missouri, and claimed that being brought to free territory made him free. Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that African-Americans were not citizens and thus did not have the right to bring a lawsuit in federal court. Taney\u2019s ruling further found that the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional</span></b> under the Property Clause. President James Buchanan supported the Court\u2019s decision in the case, which was delivered two days after his inauguration.

Homer Plessy was seven-eighths white, but he was not allowed on a whites-only car on a Louisiana train. He claimed that forced segregation violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cequal protection of the laws.\u201d</span></b> Justice Henry Brown wrote that segregation was acceptable as long as there was no clear difference in quality between the railway cars, which is often referred to with the phrase <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cseparate but equal.\u201d</span></b> Justice <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Marshall Harlan</span></b> was the lone dissenter in the 8\u20131 decision; in his dissenting opinion, he stated <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201c[o]ur Constitution is color-blind.\u201d</span></b> <i>Plessy</i> was effectively overturned by <i>Brown v.

This case was brought by nine young African-Americans, known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Scottsboro Boys</span></b>, eight of whom had been covincted of rape and sentenced to death. The Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Due Process Clause</span></b> required states\u2014in cases where the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">death penalty</span></b> was a possibility\u2014to inform defendants that they had a right to counsel, to appoint an attorney to represent defendants who could not afford one, and to do so in a manner that allowed the appointed attorney adequate time to prepare a defense (a requirement later expanded in <i class=\"ygk-term\">Gideon v.

Louis Kraemer was a white person in a white neighborhood in St. Louis that did not allow residents to sell their houses to African-Americans or Asian-Americans. The Shelleys were an African-American family that bought a house in the neighborhood. Chief Justice Fred Vinson determined that any state action enforcing the covenant would be discriminatory, and would therefore violate the Fourteenth Amendment. The case was decided 6\u20130, with three justices recusing themselves because they had racially restrictive housing covenants for their own houses. The creation of racially restrictive housing covenants was outlawed by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Fair Housing Act of 1968</span></b>.

In all of those cases, African-Americans were turned down when they tried to enroll their children in white-only schools. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thurgood Marshall</span></b>, who later became the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">first Black Supreme Court justice</span></b>, argued the case for the families. Though many lower courts ruled for the schools, based on the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d doctrine established in <i>Plessy</i>, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote a unanimous decision stating that segregated schools are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">inherently unequal</span></b> and therefore a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. In a ruling the next year, the Supreme Court determined that school integration should occur <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cwith all deliberate speed.\u201d</span></b> This inexact wording led many districts in the South to stall the implementation of integration as long as possible.</li>",

Sam Bailey was an African-American civil rights activist who worked with Medgar Evers, and Joe Patterson was the Attorney General of Mississippi. The Supreme Court ruled <i>per curiam</i> that transportation services should already be unsegregated according to the law (calling the question \u201cso well settled that it is foreclosed as a litigable issue\u201d) and that the federal judiciary in Mississippi should enforce this.</li>",

The Supreme Court decided unanimously that the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Commerce Clause</span></b> in Article\u00a0I of the Constitution allowed the federal government to desegregate hotels and motels because those businesses are impacted by interstate travel, as part of a judicial trend over the 20th century which widened the scope of the Commerce Clause.

Richard Loving, a white man, married Mildred Jeter, who was African-American, in Washington, D.C. When the couple moved to Virginia, they were in violation of the state\u2019s Racial Integrity Act of 1924, and they were told they would either have to spend a year in prison or leave the state. When that decision was upheld by the Virginia Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the Virginia law violated the Fourteenth Amendment, as its only purpose was racial discrimination. The couple remained married and in Virginia. Richard Loving was killed by a drunk driver in 1975. Mildred Loving died in 2008; the year before her death, she issued a statement of support for extending the ruling in Loving to allow same-sex couples to wed, as well.</li>",

Allan Bakke was a white person who was rejected from the University of California Medical School at Davis. The medical school set aside sixteen positions each year for minorities, and Bakke contended that he was more qualified than the minorities. The decision was confusing, with Justice <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lewis Powell</span></b> being the only justice who was both for using race as a criterion and against quotas. Four other justices supported the use of quotas, and the remaining four were against all affirmative action.

On the same day, the Supreme Court ruled on <i class=\"ygk-term\">Gratz v. Bollinger</i>, which addressed undergraduate admissions at Michigan. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that the undergraduate affirmative action program was unconstitutional because it was based on a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">point system</span></b> rather than a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">holistic look</span></b> at applicants. Together, these decisions were viewed as upholding the Bakke decision made earlier. These cases were later strengthened by two <i class=\"ygk-term\">Fisher v.

Allan Bakke was a white person who was rejected from the University of California Medical School at Davis. The medical school set aside sixteen positions each year for minorities, and Bakke contended that he was more qualified than the minorities. The decision was confusing, with Justice <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lewis Powell</span></b> being the only justice who was both for using race as a criterion and against quotas. Four other justices supported the use of quotas, and the remaining four were against all affirmative action. Bakke was admitted to the medical school; he eventually became an anesthesiologist in Minnesota.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Grutter v.

In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that the undergraduate affirmative action program was unconstitutional because it was based on a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">point system</span></b> rather than a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">holistic look</span></b> at applicants.

The primary German fighter plane was the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Messerschmitt Bf\u00a0109</span></b>, which engaged in numerous dogfights against British pilots flying <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hurricane</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Spitfire</span></b> aircraft.  Effective use of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">radar</span></b> helped to repel German forces, forcing the Luftwaffe into <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">nighttime raids against civilian targets</span></b>, a campaign known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Blitz</span></b>.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Battle of Stalingrad</span></b> (August\u00a01942\u00a0\u2013\u00a0February\u00a01943): With about <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">two million casualties</span></b>, the Battle of Stalingrad is often cited as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bloodiest battle in history</span></b>.  The battle arose out of Germany\u2019s summer campaign to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">capture vital oil supplies</span></b> in the Caucasus Mountains, but <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Friedrich Paulus\u2019s 6th\u00a0Army</span></b> became bogged down in intense street fighting in the city, allowing Soviet Marshal <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Georgy Zhukov</span></b> to launch <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Operation Uranus</span></b>, which encircled Paulus\u2019s men by defeating the Italian, Hungarian, and Romanian forces guarding their flank.  In the final days of the battle, Hitler promoted Paulus to field marshal, a not-so-subtle suggestion that Paulus should either fight to the death or commit suicide, as no German field marshal had ever been captured; Paulus <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">surrendered</span></b> anyway.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Battle of El Alamein</span></b> (October\u00a01942\u00a0\u2013\u00a0November\u00a01942): The Second Battle of El Alamein marked the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">turning point in the African campaign</span></b>.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">London, 1851: Great Exhibition\u201d</span></b> The Great Exhibition was the first ever \u201cWorld\u2019s Fair.\u201d The event was largely organized by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Prince Albert</span></b> and was held in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cCrystal Palace,\u201d</span></b> a structure nearly three times larger than St.\u00a0Paul\u2019s Cathedral. Exhibitors included <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Samuel Colt</span></b>, who brought a prototype of his \u201cNavy\u201d pistol, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mathew Brady</span></b>, a pioneer of daguerreotypes. A boating race held in conjunction with the exhibition was won by a ship called <i>America</i>, leading to its prize becoming known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">America\u2019s Cup</span></b>. It also featured the world\u2019s first modern <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pay toilets</span></b>, which cost a penny to use. The Crystal Palace remained in use for decades after the event was over, but was destroyed by a fire in 1936.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Paris, 1889: Exposition Universelle</span></b> Although Paris had hosted the World\u2019s Fair three times before, its 1889 event was easily its most iconic. It is best known for its centerpiece, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eiffel Tower</span></b>, which was by far the tallest structure in the world when it was completed. Exhibits were placed throughout the Champ de Mars, including the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cStreets of Cairo,\u201d</span></b> an elaborate interpretation of Egypt\u2019s capital. Another of its most popular attractions was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201chuman zoo,\u201d</span></b> in which various indigenous and other non-white people were put on display, a practice that was largely accepted at the time. The Eiffel Tower was scheduled to be dismantled 20 years after the 1889 fair, but its usefulness in telegraphy led to those plans being scrapped.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Chicago, 1893: World\u2019s Columbian Exposition</span></b> Chicago\u2019s 1893 fair was nicknamed the \u201cColumbian Exposition\u201d to honor the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus\u2019s voyages to the \u201cNew World.\u201d A massive pool representing Columbus\u2019s voyage served as its centerpiece. Other debuts at the fair included the first <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ferris Wheel</span></b>, the first chocolate <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">brownies</span></b>, and the first <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201csquished penny\u201d souvenirs</span></b>. The event is also associated with multiple controversies. Chicago mayor <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Carter Harrison</span></b> was assassinated during its final days, leading to the cancellation of the closing ceremony. Additionally, serial killer <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">H.\u00a0H. Holmes</span></b> and his so-called \u201cMurder Castle\u201d are often tied to the fair, though their actual connection is likely minimal. Both the fair and the associated crimes are detailed in Erik Larson\u2019s book <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Devil in the White City</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">St.\u00a0Louis, 1904: Louisiana Purchase Exposition</span></b> The 1904 World\u2019s Fair was held to honor the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase. It saw the debut of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">X-ray machine</span></b> and inspired the popular song <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cMeet Me in St.\u00a0Louis, Louis.\u201d</span></b> The fair featured daily re-enactments of battles from the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Second Boer War</span></b>, many of which featured people who had actually fought in it. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">1904 Summer Olympics</span></b> had been awarded to Chicago but were re-located to St.\u00a0Louis so they could be held alongside the fair. That change led to very sparse attendance and poorly run events over the course of several months. Novelist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kate Chopin</span></b> suffered a brain hemorrhage while visiting the 1904 fair and died two days later.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Brussels, 1958</span></b> The first full-scale world\u2019s fair after World War\u00a0II was held in Brussels in 1958. A lasting symbol of the Brussels fair is the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Atomium</span></b>, a 335-foot model of a unit cell of an iron crystal. The structure, which remains among the city\u2019s most popular attractions, is approximately 165 billion times larger than the cell it represents. The fair also featured the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Po\u00e8me \u00e9lectronique</i>, a piece of electronic music by Edgard Var\u00e8se played in a specialized pavilion designed by Le\u00a0Corbusier. The first universal poll to rank the greatest films was held at the Brussels fair, which was topped by Sergei Eisenstein\u2019s <i>Battleship Potemkin</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Seattle, 1962: Century 21</span></b> Because of the ongoing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">space race</span></b>, Seattle\u2019s fair had a strong focus on technology and aerospace. Structures built for the fair include the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Space Needle</span></b> and a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">monorail</span></b>, both of which are still standing today. Its \u201cWorld of Science\u201d building housed the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Project Mercury capsule</span></b> that took Alan Shepard to space, and its \u201cWorld of Century 21\u201d building offered glimpses of \u201cthe future\u201d of cities, cars, and air travel. John F. Kennedy intended to attend the closing of the fair, but was unable to because of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The fairgrounds, now known as the Seattle Center, has since become home to the Museum of Pop Culture.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">New York, 1964</span></b> Like the Seattle fair two years earlier, the New York fair was themed around the burgeoning <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Space Age</span></b>, particularly with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Unisphere</span></b>, a massive stainless-steel globe that served as a key symbol of the event. Pope John\u00a0XXIII allowed Michelangelo\u2019s <i>Piet\u00e0</i> to be relocated to the fair\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Vatican Pavilion</span></b>. Elsewhere, Walt Disney designed several animatronic attractions for the fair, including his first incarnation of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cIt\u2019s a Small World\u201d</span></b> ride. While it is generally named for 1964, the fair had a second \u201cseason\u201d the following year as well. A pair of observation towers left over from the fair provide a key plot point to the movie <i>Men in Black</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Montreal, 1967: Expo 67</span></b> Montreal hosted one of the biggest world fairs in history and attracted over half a million visitors just days after opening. One highlight of the fair was the unveiling of Moshe Safdie\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cHabitat 67,\u201d</span></b> a complex of hundreds of interlocking concrete buildings intended as a model community. The U.S. Pavilion at the fair was a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">geodesic dome</span></b> designed by Buckminster Fuller, which was later converted into a museum called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Biosphere</span></b>. In a notorious moment, French president Charles de\u00a0Gaulle addressed a crowd in Montreal and declared <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cLong live a free Quebec!,\u201d</span></b> angering many Canadian politicians.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Knoxville, 1982</span></b> In contrast to larger \u201cWorld Expos,\u201d Knoxville held a \u201cspecialized\u201d fair focused on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">energy</span></b>. Structures built for the event include the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sunsphere</span></b>, a 266-foot tower topped with a golden sphere. The fair also featured the debut of an early version of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">touch screen</span></b> and the introduction of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cherry Coke</span></b>. American sports were also featured during the event, with the NFL and NBA both hosting exhibition games at local venues. A fictional version of the Sunsphere had a prominent role in an episode of <i>The Simpsons</i>, in which it was converted into the \u201cWigsphere,\u201d a shop for discount wigs.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Dubai, 2020</span></b> The most recent world fair was scheduled for Dubai in 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it ultimately began in September 2021. The U.S. built a 36,000-square-foot pavilion for the fair, which featured artifacts like <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Thomas Jefferson\u2019s copy of the Qur\u2019an</span></b> and a moon rock from the Apollo\u00a017 mission. The fair also played host to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">2021 World Chess Championship</span></b>, which was won by defending champion Magnus Carlsen. Shortly before the fair began, the European Parliament formally <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">opposed</span></b> the event, citing the UAE\u2019s human rights record, though it had little effect on attendance.</li>"
