Mount Erebus sits on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ross Island</span></b>. It took its name from the primordial personification of darkness in Greek mythology. The northeast slope of Mount Erebus is known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cFang Ridge,\u201d</span></b> and the volcano\u2019s underground magma produces unique pieces of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">feldspar</span></b> known as \u201cErebus crystals.\u201d In 1979 an Air New Zealand jet crashed into the side of Mount Erebus, killing 257 people.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Mount Etna</span></b> is a stratovolcano in eastern <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sicily</span></b> that plays a significant role in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ancient Greek myths</span></b>. Zeus trapped the monster <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Typhon</span></b> under Mount Etna, and the volcano is also the site of Hephaestus\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">forges</span></b>. Mount Etna overlooks the Sicilian town of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Catania</span></b>. It most recently erupted in 2015. Earlier eruptions occurred in 1928 (destroying the village of Mascali) and in 1669, after which the volcano was thought to have gone dormant. There is a large depression on the side of Mount Etna known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Valle del Bove</span></b>, or \u201cValley of the Ox.\u201d</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Mount Fuji</span></b>, a stratovolcano on the island of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Honshu</span></b>, is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Japan</span></b>\u2019s tallest mountain.

The name \u201cKilauea\u201d means \u201cspewing\u201d or \u201cspreading\u201d in the Hawaiian language. In Hawaiian mythology, the volcano is the home of the fire goddess <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pele</span></b>. The three primary craters of Kilauea are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Halema\u02bbuma\u02bbu</span></b> Crater, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pu\u02bbu</span></b> Crater, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pu\u02bbu \u02bbO\u02bbo</span></b> Crater. In addition, part of the volcano is covered by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ka\u02bbu Desert</span></b>, a plain of dried lava and volcanic ash.

Prior to its massive <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">1883 eruption</span></b>, there were three separate volcanic peaks: <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Perboewatan</span></b> (completely destroyed by the eruption), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rakata</span></b> (extant), and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Danan</span></b> (almost completely destroyed). The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa killed more than 35,000 people and is believed to have produced the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">loudest sound ever</span></b>. Krakatoa is one of the largest volcanoes in the Pacific <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ring of Fire</span></b>.

It should not be confused with Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano that is the tallest mountain in Hawaii. Both Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa are taller than Mount Everest when measuring from base-to-summit rather than from sea level. Along with Kilauea, Mauna Loa forms the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park</span></b>, which was established in 1916 by Woodrow Wilson. When Mauna Loa erupted in 1942, four months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government gagged the press from reporting on the eruption.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Mount Pinatubo</span></b> is a stratovolcano in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Zambales Mountains</span></b> on the eastern coast of the island of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Luzon</span></b> in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Philippines</span></b>. In the aftermath of its <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">1991 eruption</span></b>, the global temperature briefly decreased by almost a full degree Fahrenheit due to the ejection of aerosols and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sulfuric acid</span></b>. That eruption was ten times more powerful than the 1980 eruption of Mount Saint Helens; it killed at least 800 people and forced the evacuation of some 20,000 people. In its aftermath, monsoon rains created <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Lake Pinatubo</span></b> in the resulting crater. In 2010, the indigenous <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aeta people</span></b> were formally granted domain over the volcano.</li>",

It is located about 50 miles southeast of Seattle. The three principal peaks of Mount Rainier are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Columbia Crest</span></b> (the tallest), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Point Success</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Liberty Cap</span></b>; the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Little Tahoma Peak</span></b> is a remnant of an older, much larger Mount Rainier that has since eroded away. Mount Rainier has not erupted since the mid-to-late nineteenth century. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Nisqually Glacier</span></b>, on Mount Rainier\u2019s southwestern slope, is used to track climate change. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Emmons Glacier</span></b> on Mount Rainier is the largest glacier by area in the contiguous U.S., while the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Carbon Glacier</span></b> is the largest by volume. The entirety of Mount Rainier is in Mount Rainier National Park, the fifth national park established in the U.S.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Mount Saint Helens</span></b> is another stratovolcano in the Cascades of Washington state. It is about 100 miles south of Seattle and about 50 miles north of Portland. It last <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">erupted in May 1980</span></b>, killing 57 people in the most devastating volcanic eruption in U.S. history. Perhaps the most famous casualty of that eruption was an innkeeper named <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Harry Truman</span></b> (no relation to the president of the same name) who refused to evacuate from the mountain. Because of an avalanche of volcanic debris during that eruption, Mount Saint Helens lost about 1300 feet in height; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">lahars</span></b> (mudflows of pyroclastic material) reached all the way to the Columbia River. The volcano is surrounded by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Gifford Pinchot National Forest</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Mount Vesuvius</span></b> is a stratovolcano on the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Gulf of Naples</span></b> in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Campania</span></b> in south-central Italy. Mount Vesuvius, which last erupted in 1944, is the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">only active volcano on mainland Europe</span></b>. The most notable eruption of Mount Vesuvius was in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">AD\u00a079</span></b> when it buried the Roman cities of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pompeii</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Herculaneum</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Stabiae</span></b>. The only surviving eyewitness accounts of that eruption are a pair of letters written by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pliny the Younger</span></b> to Tacitus. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">1908 Summer Olympics</span></b> were relocated from Rome to London after a surprise eruption of Mount Vesuvius.</li>"

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Empiricism</span></b> is the view that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">all knowledge derives from sensory experience</span></b>.  <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Locke</span></b>, whose works include <i class=\"ygk-term\">An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</i>, thought that the mind starts out as a <i class=\"ygk-term\">tabula rasa</i> \u2014 (blank slate) and that we <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gain knowledge through experiences</span></b>.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Rationalism</span></b>, which is often <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">contrasted with empiricism</span></b>, asserts that we <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gain knowledge through intuition</span></b> or our rational nature rather than through experience.  A version of this doctrine was espoused by the Greek philosopher <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Plato</span></b> in his <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Theory of Forms</span></b>, which states that abstract ideas (\u201cforms\u201d) are more real than the material world of the senses.

Not only has this phrase has been used in extremely varied contexts, but it is also followed by another phrase that, in altered form, has become a common Judeo-Christian credo: \u201cfor dust you are, and to dust you will return,\u201d which is typically shortened to \u201c(from) dust to dust.\u201d\r\n\t</li>",

Its passage of origin describes the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the two \u201ccities of the plain\u201d whose residents were so sinful (Sodom is the etymological source of the word \u201csodomy\u201d) that God rained brimstone (sulfur) and fire to obliterate them for mistreating Lot and his family. This phrase also appears in Revelation, which describes the \u201clake which burneth with fire and brimstone\u201d where the souls of sinners die a \u201csecond death.\u201d\r\n\t</li>",
                "<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">a land of milk and honey</span></b>, from Leviticus\u00a020:24, among others: \u201cBut I said to you, \u2018You will possess their land; I will give it to you as an inheritance, a land flowing with milk and honey.\u2019 I am the Lord your God, who has set you apart from the nations.\u201d\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tMentioned at least four times in the Old Testament, a \u201cland flowing with milk and honey\u201d is the homeland bestowed by God upon the Hebrews. It is the same place as \u201cthe promised land,\u201d an epithet derived from the word \u201cpromise\u201d in Deuteronomy 6:3 (which also uses the \u201cmilk and honey\u201d descriptor), and is now used in common parlance to identify any land of plenty. The phrase first appears in Exodus 3:8 when God\u0097in the form of the burning bush\u0097 promises to lead Moses to a \u201cland flowing with milk and honey.\u201d\r\n\t</li>",

Then they said, \u2018These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.\u2019\u201d\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tAaron is the older brother of Moses who, while Moses spends 40 days and 40 nights up on Mt. Sinai receiving the Ten Commandments from God, grows impatient and (against God\u2019s will) forges a golden calf to worship; when Moses sees the idol, he throws down and shatters the commandment tablets. Today, a metaphorical \u201cgolden calf\u201d is any object of desire or ambition that is regarded as immoral or ungenuine\u0097for this reason, Charging Bull, the bronze statue of a bull in New York City that symbolizes Wall Street, is held up as both a literal and figurative golden calf by critics of capitalism.\r\n\t</li>",

Jezebel, a pagan, married King Ahab and used her influence as queen to diminish worship of Yahweh in Israel, threaten the prophet Elijah, and help Ahab kill a vineyard owner. For these actions, Elijah prophesied Ahab\u2019s death, as well as Jezebel\u2019s (namely, that she would be eaten by dogs). Jezebel\u2019s reputation as wanton seems to primarily derive from how, upon seeing Jehu (an enemy commander) marching on the palace, Jezebel put on make-up and jewelry to either taunt him, seduce him, or simply look regal. This was her final act; Jehu ordered eunuchs to push Jezebel from her window, where she fell into the street and had her flesh devoured by dogs.\r\n\t</li>",

What strength it has in its loins, what power in the muscles of its belly! \u2026 Its bones are tubes of bronze, its limbs like rods of iron.\u201d\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tDepending on translation, the monster Behemoth either was the first or the mightiest thing God created. Near the end of the Book of Job (which concerns a wager between God and Satan to see if God\u2019s most righteous believer, Job, will lose his faith if deprived of all pleasure and comfort), Job begins cursing God. God appears as a storm and asserts that He alone created order out of chaos and that Job knows nothing. At the end a long speech about His power, God shows Job both Behemoth and the monster Leviathan to prove his ultimate power and wisdom. Behemoth, thus, has come to mean any unbeatable foe or gigantic entity.\r\n\t</li>",

The king watched the hand as it wrote.\u201d\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tBelshazzar was a king of Babylon whose sin and theft from Jerusalem\u2019s First Temple doomed him. At a feast, the hand of God appeared and wrote out a blazing message on the wall. The prophet Daniel alone could read God\u2019s message: Belshazzar\u2019s soul was wicked, his death had been arranged, and his kingdom would be conquered. So rarely was God\u2019s plan for a human made so public; \u201cseeing the writing on the wall\u201d has become an idiom for recognizing the obvious signs of an imminent outcome (especially a terrible one).\r\n\t</li>",

A similar message appears later in Matthew in the form of another common idiom: Jesus advises followers \u201cshake the dust from your feet\u201d when leaving places where their preaching goes unheeded. Both phrases have lost their religious overtones in regular usage: \u201cpearls before swine\u201d identifies something valuable or beautiful that goes unappreciated, while \u201cshaking the dust from your feet\u201d often describes an ambitious person moving out of a small town.\r\n\t</li>",

The emphasis in the parable is that the Samaritan is good despite Samaritans\u2019 general hatred of Jews; the parable is created by Jesus to answer the question of who is truly a man\u2019s neighbor, the implicit answer being every man. The directness of the parable has left its original sense wholly intact: today, a \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d is someone who stops to help, regardless of circumstance or inconvenience.\r\n\t</li>",
                "<li>\n<b><span class=\"label\">ye of little faith</span></b>, from Matthew\u00a06:30, \u201cIf God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?\u201d\r\n\t\t<br/>\r\n\t\tUttered in modern English in response to doubters and critics, this phrase occurs in the context of a passage known as \u201cThe Lilies of the Field\u201d or \u201cThe Birds of the Air\u201d in another section of Jesus\u2019s Sermon on the Mount. To comfort those who worry about survival and day-to-day life, Jesus tells his followers, \u201cConsider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin. And yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\u201d Thus, Jesus claims that if a person devotes themself to God, they must trust that God will eventually reward and protect them. Today, the phrase is often used outside of any religious context, as a (sometimes sarcastic) rebuke.\r\n\t</li>"

Abraham then makes a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">covenant</span></b> with the Lord, who promises that his descendants will be as numerous as the stars of the sky and the sands of the seashore. In Islamic tradition, Abraham (known as Ibrahim) is instead told to sacrifice his son Ishmael, whose mother is the concubine Hagar. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are collectively known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Abrahamic religions</span></b> due to Abraham\u2019s central role in the scriptures of all three.</li>",

In Isaac\u2019s old age, he intends to bless Jacob\u2019s elder twin brother <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Esau</span></b>, but Jacob wears goatskins to impersonate his sibling and receives the blessing instead. While traveling to his uncle Laban to escape Esau\u2019s wrath, he has a vision of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">angels moving up and down a ladder to heaven</span></b>. After working for seven years, he is given Laban\u2019s daughter <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Leah</span></b> in marriage, but works another seven years to marry Laban\u2019s daughter <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rachel</span></b> instead. His name is changed to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Israel</span></b> after he spends a night wrestling with an angel; the angel defeats him by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">striking his hip socket</span></b>, which is why Jewish law forbids eating the sciatic muscle. Jacob\u2019s sons become the heads of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Twelve Tribes of Israel</span></b>; his son <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joseph</span></b> receives a coat of many colors, is sold into slavery by his brothers, and becomes vizier for the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pharaoh of Egypt</span></b>.</li>",

He is abandoned in a basket as a child and is raised by the pharaoh\u2019s daughter. After killing an Egyptian overseer, he flees to the land of Midian, where the Lord appears to him in a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">burning bush</span></b>. Moses and his brother <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Aaron</span></b> go before the pharaoh to request he release the Israelites from bondage. When the pharaoh refuses, the Lord afflicts Egypt with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ten Plagues</span></b>, the last of which causes the death of every first-born male child. The Israelites avoid this by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">painting their doorposts with lamb\u2019s blood</span></b>, a ritual that leads to the establishment of the holiday of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Passover</span></b>. Moses then leads the Israelites out of Egypt by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">parting the Red Sea</span></b>, after which they spend 40\u00a0years wandering in the desert. Moses receives the tablets of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ten Commandments</span></b> from the Lord on Mount Sinai, but smashes them in anger when he sees the people worshipping a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">golden calf</span></b>. Moses dies before entering the Promised Land and is succeeded by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Joshua</span></b> as the leader of the Israelites. Since the books of the Jewish Torah (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) are attributed to Moses, the rules set forth in the Torah are known as the Mosaic Law.</li>",

After falling in love with a Philistine woman and preparing to marry her, Samson tells the groomsmen a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">riddle</span></b> involving honey in the carcass of a lion; the groomsmen force his betrothed to tell them the answer. Samson\u2019s betrothed is eventually married to another man, causing an enraged Samson to burn the Philistines\u2019 crops and slay 1,000 men with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">jawbone of a donkey</span></b>. Samson\u2019s downfall comes when he falls in love with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Delilah</span></b>, who seduces him for the secret of his strength, then cuts his hair while he is asleep. He is captured and blinded by the Philistines, who display him in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Temple of Dagon</span></b>.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Samuel</span></b> is a prophet and the namesake of the two books that follow Ruth and precede 1\u00a0Kings. Samuel\u2019s mother, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hannah</span></b>, prays to the Lord for a child, and promises that should she conceive a son she will dedicate him to the service of the Lord. Shortly thereafter, Hannah becomes pregnant with Samuel. When Samuel is a young boy, the Lord calls to him during the night, though he mistakes the voice for that of the head priest <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Eli</span></b>, whose downfall he subsequently foretells. As an adult, Samuel leads Israel to a major victory over the Philistines at Mizpah, erecting the stone Ebenezer on the site. At the Israelites\u2019 request, he <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">anoints Saul</span></b> as the first king of Israel; Saul eventually loses his favor by sparing King Agag of the Amalekites in battle. After Samuel\u2019s death, Saul calls upon the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Witch of Endor</span></b> to summon up Samuel\u2019s ghost; Samuel\u2019s spirit predicts a crushing defeat for Israel at the hands of the Philistines.</li>",

David succeeded Saul as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">King of Israel</span></b> and is traditionally held to be a direct ancestor of Jesus. David first takes command of Israel\u2019s army after he uses a simple sling to slay the massive Philistine champion <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Goliath</span></b>, an event depicted in sculpture by Michelangelo and Donatello, among others. Though Saul becomes jealous of David and tries to kill him, David escapes with the help of Saul\u2019s son <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jonathan</span></b>, with whom he shares a deep relationship that some modern scholars have interpreted as romantic. As king, David captures the city of Jerusalem and installs the Ark of the Covenant there. He falls in love with the married woman <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bathsheba</span></b> and sends her husband Uriah the Hittite to be killed in battle; this earns him a strong rebuke from the prophet Nathan. David\u2019s children include <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Absalom</span></b>, who leads a rebellion against him.

As a young man, Solomon is visited by the Lord, who asks what Solomon desires; Solomon\u2019s reply of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cwisdom\u201d</span></b> pleased the Lord, who granted the request. In the best-known episode illustrating Solomon\u2019s wisdom, he orders that a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">child be cut in half</span></b> to determine its true mother. Under Solomon\u2019s rule, Israel built the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">First Temple of Jerusalem</span></b>, also known as the Temple of Solomon, whose innermost chamber housed the Ark of the Covenant.

(The beginning of the ecclesiastic year is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pesach</span></b>.) It is believed that on Rosh HaShanah, people\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">souls are judged</span></b>, and God \u201ctemporarily\u201d <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">decides their fate</span></b> for the coming year. Between Rosh HaShanah and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Yom Kippur</span></b> are the Ten Days of Repentance, when people are given a chance to reflect and repent. On Rosh HaShanah, it is customary to wear white clothes and eat <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">apples with honey</span></b> for a sweet year, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pomegranates</span></b> to represent being as fruitful as its many seeds.  Other customs include the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">blowing of the <i>shofar</i></span></b> (an instrument made from a ram\u2019s horn) and a ceremony called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tashlich</span></b>, in which Jews throw bread crumbs into running water to symbolize the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cleansing of their sins</span></b>.</li>",

Jews are required to abstain from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">eating</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">drinking</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">washing</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sex</span></b>, as well as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">indulgent dress</span></b> such as jewelry, make-up, and leather.  One traditionally wears <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">white clothes</span></b> to symbolize purity. In the afternoon, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Book of Jonah</span></b> is read.  A full day of prayers begins with the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Kol Nidre</i>, which releases Jews from vows or promises to God.  As on Rosh HaShanah, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">shofar</span></b> is blown unless it is Shabbat, in which case the shofar is blown only during the final service, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">N\u2019ila</span></b> (meaning \u201cclosing,\u201d since the Temple gates were closed for this service).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Sukkot</span></b>: Celebrated on the 15th of Tishrei, Sukkot commemorates the sukkot (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">booths</span></b>) that the Israelites lived in following the Exodus from Egypt; it also celebrates the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">harvest</span></b>.

It celebrates the victory of the small <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Maccabee army</span></b> against the large Greek army of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Antiochus</span></b>, and the Maccabees\u2019 recapture and re-purification of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Temple in Jerusalem</span></b> (c.\u00a0168\u00a0BC).  When they did so, they found only a small amount of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">oil</span></b> to light the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">menorah</span></b> in the Temple, and it would take a week to make more; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">miraculously</span></b>, the oil burned for the full week. To commemorate this, on each night, observers use a \u201chelper candle\u201d called the <i class=\"ygk-term\">shamash</i> to light candles in a menorah (more properly called a <i class=\"ygk-term\">chanukiah</i>, as a menorah only has six branches while a chanukiah has nine): one candle (besides the shamash) on the first night, two on the second night, and so on. Furthermore, it is traditional to eat foods fried in oil; in the United States, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">potato pancakes</span></b> called <i class=\"ygk-term\">latkes</i> are popular; in Israel, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fried jelly donuts</span></b> called <i class=\"ygk-term\">sufganiyot</i> are more common. Children play a game with a spinning a top called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dreidel</span></b>, which contains the Hebrew letters that form the initials of a phrase that translates as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201ca great miracle happened there\u201d</span></b> (in Israel, they say <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201ca great miracle happened here\u201d</span></b>). Exchanging <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">presents</span></b> is only a recent tradition developed in the U.S. to make Jewish children feel less left out as their Christian peers get Christmas presents (or, if you are cynical, the tradition was invented by toymakers to sell more toys).</li>",

It is also the ancient Hebrew New Year.  On the first day or two days, Jews have a festival dinner called a <i class=\"ygk-term\">seder</i>, where they retell the story of the Exodus from a book called a <i class=\"ygk-term\">hagaddah</i>.  Jews are required to abstain from eating or owning <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">leavened bread</span></b>, and anything made with leaven, for the duration of the festival; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">matzah</span></b> (a flat unleavened bread) is eaten instead.  On Passover, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Song of Songs</span></b> is recited.  Passover also begins a period of seven weeks called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Omer</span></b>, a period of semi-mourning that leads into <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Shavuot</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Shavuot</span></b>: Celebrated on the sixth day of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sivan</span></b> (the ninth month), the 50th day of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Omer</span></b> that began after Passover.  The word Shavuot means \u201cweeks,\u201d (seven weeks of the Omer), hence the name of the homologous Christian holiday <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pentecost</span></b>. Shavuot commemorates the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">giving of the Torah</span></b> to the Israelites at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mount Sinai</span></b>, as well as the beginning of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">harvest</span></b> in ancient Israel.

It is traditional to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fast</span></b> and to keep oneself in a solemn mood.

This practice derives from God\u2019s instruction to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Abraham</span></b>, after which Abraham circumcised himself and later circumcised his son <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Isaac</span></b>. It is done to all boys when they reach <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">eight days old</span></b> (unless a health condition requires a delay) by a professional called a <i class=\"ygk-term\">mohel</i> <b><span class=\"pg\">MOY-ul in Yiddish/Ashkanazi dialect</span></b>. During the operation, the boy is held by a person (often a grandfather) designated the <i class=\"ygk-term\">sandek</i>, which is an honor. Medical anesthetic is not used, but often the baby is given a drop of wine. The ritual is followed by a <i class=\"ygk-term\">s\u2019udah</i>, a celebratory meal.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Baby naming</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"label\">simchat bat.</span></b> Jewish children are given <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hebrew names</span></b>. For boys, the name is formally announced, and blessings are recited, at the <i>brit milah</i> ceremony. For girls, the same is done at a separate event, often (but not necessarily) during a regular synagogue service in the first few weeks of the baby\u2019s life. This tradition is primarily observed in more liberal Jewish movements and is not considered religiously required, so practices vary and are evolving. The Hebrew name is used on special occasions such as being called to the Torah and being married, and is typically in the form \u201cYitzchak ben Avraham\u201d (Isaac, son of Abraham) or (in egalitarian movements) \u201cYitzchak ben Avraham v\u2019Sarah\u201d (Isaac, son of Abraham and Sarah).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Pidyon ha-ben.</span></b> Traditionally, by default, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">firstborn sons</span></b> are obligated to assist in the Temple in Jerusalem. As there is currently no Temple, this requirement is symbolic, but it is traditional to \u201credeem\u201d such people from their obligations if possible. Children in priestly families (<i class=\"ygk-term\">kohanim</i>, singular <i class=\"ygk-term\">kohen</i>, descendants of Moses\u2019s brother Aaron) and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Levite</span></b> families (descendants of Levi) cannot be redeemed from service. Traditionally, the child\u2019s father pays a <i>kohen</i> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">five silver coins</span></b> in exchange for the child\u2019s freedom, shortly after the child becomes one month old. Blessings and a meal accompany the ritual.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Bar/bat mitzvah</span></b> (masculine and feminine singular, respectively; masculine, mixed, or nonspecific plural <b><span class=\"label\">b\u2019nai mitzvah</span></b>; feminine plural <b><span class=\"label\">b\u2019not mitzvah</span></b>; feminine singular in Yiddish/Ashkenazi dialect <b><span class=\"label\">bas mitzvah</span></b>) is the designation that a Jewish person has reached adulthood. Traditionally this is at <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">age 13</span></b> for boys/men and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">age 12</span></b> for girls/women. Although a <i>bar/bat mitzvah</i> occurs upon the birthday regardless of whether any ceremony takes place, traditionally the occasion is marked at a service at the synagogue around that time; the honoree will wear a <i class=\"ygk-term\">tallit</i> (prayer shawl) for the first time, be called up for an honor (<i class=\"ygk-term\">aliyah</i>) for the first time, read from the <i class=\"ygk-term\">Torah</i> (first five books of the Bible) and <i class=\"ygk-term\">haftarah</i> (a portion of one of the prophets\u2019 books, linked to the week\u2019s Torah portion), and give a <i class=\"ygk-term\">d\u2019var Torah</i>, a discourse on the meaning of the week\u2019s Torah portion. A celebratory meal or party often follows.  The <i>bar mitzvah</i> for boys dates back to ancient times in varying forms; the <i>bat mitzvah</i> mainly arose in the 20th century. After becoming <i>bar mitzvah</i>, a man is responsible for fulfilling the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">613 commandments</span></b> in the Torah and may be counted toward a <i class=\"ygk-term\">minyan</i> (quorum required for certain prayers); in egalitarian movements the same applies to a woman who has become <i>bat mitzvah</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Confirmation</span></b> is a modern ritual (developed in the 19th century) and is non-obligatory. It is primarily used in more secular movements, and represents the fact that a person has continued formal Jewish education past the <i>bar/bat mitzvah</i> and has now completed that formal education. Rituals vary widely, but generally there is recognition in the synagogue of the confirmation class (all at once, unlike for <i>b\u2019nai mitzvah</i>), religious gifts may be given, and\u2014as with nearly all Jewish events\u2014food is served.</li>",
                "<li>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Marriage</span></b> in Judaism is a complex ritual that varies according to the couple\u2019s and their community\u2019s relationships with Judaism. For the sake of brevity, here we will discuss marriages between a Jewish man and a Jewish woman. Jewish attitudes and approaches toward non-heterosexual marriages are too varied and evolving to summarize here, and Judaism discourages Jewish people from marrying non-Jewish people (intermarriage).</p>\n<p>In many communities, especially Ashkenazic ones, the wedding is preceded by an <i class=\"ygk-term\">aufruf</i>: on the Shabbat (Saturday) before the wedding, the groom is (or in egalitarian congregations, the bride and the groom are) called to the Torah to receive an honor and a blessing, after which the congregation sings to them and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pelts them with candy</span></b>, representing a sweet life.</p>\n<p>Immediately before the wedding proper, two witnesses sign a <i class=\"ygk-term\">ketubah</i>, or marriage contract, which details the groom\u2019s obligations toward the bride (home, food, clothing, sex, faithfulness). In egalitarian movements the wording is adjusted and the bride and groom also sign. The <i>ketubah</i> is frequently a beautiful, illuminated document, and the couple will often display it in their home.</p>\n<p>The wedding ceremony takes place under a <i class=\"ygk-term\">chuppah</i>, a canopy supported on four poles, symbolizing the couple\u2019s home. The bride\u2019s face is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">veiled</span></b>\u2014recalling Genesis, in which Laban tricked Jacob into marrying Leah rather than Rachel by having the bride veiled at the ceremony, but to prevent such an occurrence, the groom removes the veil to verify that he will marry the correct person. The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bride walks around the groom</span></b> three or seven times. The groom presents the bride with an object of value (typically a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ring</span></b>), and in egalitarian weddings, vice versa. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Seven blessings</span></b> (Hebrew: <i class=\"ygk-term\">sheva b\u2019rachot</i>) formalize the marriage. The groom <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">breaks a glass</span></b> (or in egalitarian movements, the bride and groom may break a glass together) to remind the community that even at a joyous occasion there is still sorrow (particularly with respect to the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem).</p>\n<p>The wedding is followed by a festive meal and party. Dancing is common, especially the <i class=\"ygk-term\">hora</i>, and it is traditional to lift the bride and groom on chairs. Traditionally, a special version of <i class=\"ygk-term\">birkat ha-mazon</i> (grace after meals) is recited.</p>\n</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Divorce</span></b> is discouraged, but permitted, in Judaism. It is effected by a document called a <i class=\"ygk-term\">get</i>. By Jewish law, a husband must present a wife with a <i>get</i> of his own free will, and traditionally (but not by law) she must choose to accept it. The former presents an obvious problem when a wife wishes to be divorced but her husband does not. This is a considerable problem in observant Jewish communities and has led to a variety of attempted solutions of varying acceptance and effectiveness (usually in the form of some sort of prenuptial agreement, but occasionally <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/10/rabbis-fbi-divorce-sting/2959369/\">more creative, less legal forms</a>).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Death.</span></b> A deceased person\u2019s body is not embalmed; rather, it is ritually washed by members of a group called the <i class=\"ygk-term\">chevra kadisha</i> (literally \u201choly society\u201d), who then dress the body in a simple linen garment (<i class=\"ygk-term\">tachrich</i>), place it in a simple <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">wooden casket</span></b> (no metal, so that the body\u2019s return to dust is hastened), and stay with the deceased while reciting psalms. At the funeral, there is no viewing. Eulogies may be given, and mourners may recite psalms (especially <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Psalm\u00a023</span></b>, \u201cThe Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want) and <i class=\"ygk-term\">El Malei Rachamim</i> (\u201cGod, full of mercy\u201d). Cremation is forbidden, and burial should take place as soon as possible. At the burial, mourners take turns <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">shoveling dirt</span></b> into the grave, but do not pass the shovel directly to one another. A common myth states that having a tattoo prevents one from being buried in a Jewish cemetery; though Judaism discourages tattoos, that is not true. Proper treatment of the dead is considered a critical <i class=\"ygk-term\">mitzvah</i> (both commandment and good deed) because the beneficiary (the deceased person) cannot offer repayment or express gratitude.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Mourning</span></b> commences immediately upon hearing of a death, when one traditionally recites a blessing that translates to \u201cBlessed are you, Lord our God, king of the Universe, the judge of truth\u201d (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201c\u2026dayan ha-emet\u201d</span></b>) and one may <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tear their clothes</span></b>. (The latter tradition is sometimes echoed with mourners wearing a ribbon at a funeral, which they ritually tear.) After burial, <i class=\"ygk-term\">shiva</i> begins\u2014a seven-day period of mourning (colloquially in English, \u201csitting shiva\u201d) during which the family of the deceased person receives visitors at home, shares recollections of the deceased, prays communally, and eats traditional comfort foods (e.g., eggs, whose round shape recalls the cycle of life). Mourners minimize vanity (keeping personal grooming to a minimum, covering mirrors, not wearing fancy clothes such as those involving leather) and avoid joyous events. A period of less intense mourning, <i class=\"ygk-term\">shloshim</i> (literally, \u201cthirty\u201d) lasts 30 days after burial, during which mourners continue avoiding joyous events, and specifically in the case of people mourning a parent, a less intense period of mourning lasts a year following the death.

            [
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Supply</span></b> and <b><span class=\"label\">Demand</span></b>.  Supply and demand embody the general idea that, at any given price, producers are willing to produce a given amount of a good (the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quantity supplied</span></b>) and consumers are willing to buy a different amount (the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quantity demanded</span></b>).  As the price rises, firms will be willing to supply more goods, but fewer will be demanded; conversely, as price falls, consumers will demand more goods, but fewer will be supplied.  On a graph showing price and quantity on its two axes, this is represented by a downward-sloping <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">demand curve</span></b> and an upward-sloping <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">supply curve</span></b>.  Where the two curves intersect, there is an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">equilibrium</span></b>; economists predict this equilibrium quantity will be produced (and consumed) in a free market.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Elasticity</span></b>.  Elasticity is a measure of how much one economic variable changes in response to a change in a different variable, expressed in the form of \u201cEvery 1% change in the independent (second) variable leads to an <i>x</i>% change in the value of the first (dependent) variable.\u201d  A common example is the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">price elasticity of demand</span></b>, which measures the degree to which the quantity demanded changes when the price is altered.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Monopoly</span></b>.  A monopoly occurs when there is only one firm producing goods for a given market.  This allows that firm to set the price higher\u2014and thus the quantity sold lower\u2014than would otherwise occur.  An <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">oligopoly</span></b> is a similar market environment where production is dominated by a few firms, whereas a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">monopsony</span></b> is the opposite case:  a market with only a single consumer.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Tariff</span></b>.  A tariff is a tax placed on the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">import</span></b> (common) or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">export</span></b> (rarer) of a good.  Tariffs have various \u2014 often controversial \u2014 sociopolitical goals, but economists agree that they raise consumer prices relative to equilibrium (resulting in a lower quantity demanded).  Tariffs are similar to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quotas</span></b>, in which a government limits the amount of a good that may be imported.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Factors of production</span></b>.  There are three classical factors of production:  <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">land</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">labor</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">capital</span></b> (i.e., machinery and tools).  Modern economists sometimes add a fourth, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">entrepreneurship</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Unemployment</span></b>.  The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unemployment rate</span></b> refers to the percentage of the population that is actively seeking work but cannot find a job. Unemployment can be <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cyclical</span></b> (common in seasonal industries like fieldwork), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">frictional</span></b> (the natural time between jobs that exists in most labor markets), or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">structural</span></b> (when workers\u2019 skills do not match those required by open jobs).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Gross Domestic Product</span></b>.  Gross domestic product (or <b><span class=\"label\">GDP</span></b>), is a commonly used measure of the size of a country\u2019s or state\u2019s economy.  GDP is computed by summing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">consumption</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">investment</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">government expenditures</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">exports</span></b>, and then subtracting <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">imports</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Inflation.</span></b>  The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">inflation rate</span></b> is the pace at which prices are rising, usually expressed in the form \u201c2.5% per year.\u201d  This is equivalent to the rate at which currency loses its value.  Inflation is often measured by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">consumer price index</span></b>, which establishes a standard <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">basket of goods</span></b> that a family might buy and seeing how its total price changes over a year.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Interest rate</span></b>.  The interest rate is a \u201cprice of money,\u201d inasmuch as it is the amount one must pay to use somebody else\u2019s money (\u201cborrow\u201d) for a given period of time; the term is also used for the payment the lender (e.g., a person with a savings account) receives for loaning out his money.  Because <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">inflation</span></b> lowers the value of currency, economists routinely distinguish between <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">nominal interest rates</span></b> (the actual amount earned by a lender/saver) and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">real interest rates</span></b> (which are corrected for the inflation rate).  A savings account earning 5% interest is not acquiring the ability to buy more things if prices are also going up by 5% per year!</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Comparative advantage</span></b>.  Comparative advantage is the idea that every pair of potential trading partners (two firms, two neighbors, two countries, etc.) can benefit by trade if they are producing at least two goods.  The counterintuitive aspect is that this result is true for <em>every</em> pair, no matter how <em>un</em>productive one of the parties might be (in absolute terms).  Broadly speaking, each party should specialize in what it does best (relative to the other party) and then trade for everything else.  David Ricardo formulated this theory with a famous example involving Britain\u2019s cloth industry and Portugal\u2019s wine industry.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Invisible hand</span></b>.  The invisible hand is the metaphorical notion that producers and consumers acting in their own narrow interest (e.g., by trying to maximize income from their business) will create an overall benefit to society.  This might happen by their rewarding technologies that make production more efficient, rewarding firms who can sell at lower cost, rewarding inventors who discover new processes, and so on.  The phrase was introduced by Adam Smith in his 1776 book <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>, but the modern understanding (and broad-based application of the metaphor) is due to later thinkers.</li>"

He went on to create the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">analytic psychology</span></b> movement and introduced the controversial notion of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">collective unconscious</span></b> \u2014 a socially shared area of the mind.  Quiz bowlers should be familiar with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">anima</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">animus</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">introversion</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">extroversion</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">archetypes</span></b>, all terms that occur frequently in questions on Jung. (Of course, being familiar with them entails knowing what specifically they mean, and how they relate to Jung\u2019s work.)</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Alfred Adler</span></b> (Austrian, 1870\u20131937): Alfred Adler was another close associate of Freud who <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">split</span></b> with him over Freud\u2019s insistence that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sexual issues were at the root of neuroses</span></b> and most psychological problems.  Adler argued in <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Neurotic Constitution</i> that neuroses resulted from people\u2019s inability to achieve <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">self-realization</span></b>; in failing to achieve this sense of completeness, they developed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cinferiority complexes\u201d</span></b> that inhibited their relations with successful people and dominated their relations with fellow unsuccessful people, a theory given the general name <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cindividual psychology.\u201d</span></b></li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Ivan Pavlov</span></b> (Russian 1849\u20131936): Ivan Pavlov was more of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">physiologist</span></b> than a psychologist, but questions about him are more often classified as psychology than biology by question writers.  He is largely remembered for his idea of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">conditioned reflex</span></b>, for example, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">salivation</span></b> of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dog</span></b> at the sound of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bell</span></b> that presages dinner, even though the bell itself is inedible and has <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">no intrinsic connection</span></b> with food.  He won the Nobel Prize in 1904 for Physiology or Medicine for unrelated work on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">digestive secretions</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">John B. Watson</span></b> (American, 1878\u20131958): John Watson was the first prominent exponent of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">behaviorism</span></b>; he codified its tenets in <i class=\"ygk-term\">Behavior: An Introduction to Comparative Psychology</i>, arguing that psychology could be completely grounded in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">objective measurements</span></b> of events and physical human reactions.  His most famous experiment involved <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">conditioning</span></b> an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">eleven-month-old boy</span></b> to be apprehensive of all <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">furry objects</span></b> by striking a loud bell whenever a furry object was placed in his lap.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">B.\u00a0F. Skinner</span></b> (American, 1904\u20131990): B.\u00a0F. Skinner was one of the leading proponents of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">behaviorism</span></b> in works like <i class=\"ygk-term\">Walden\u00a0II</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">Beyond Freedom and Dignity</i>.  He argued that all human actions could be understood in terms of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">physical stimuli</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">learned responses</span></b>, and that there was no need to study \u2014 or even believe in \u2014 internal mental states or motivations; in fact, doing so could be harmful.  Guided by his ideas, he trained animals to perform complicated tasks, including <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">teaching pigeons to play table tennis</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Jean Piaget</span></b> (Swiss, 1896\u20131980): Jean Piaget is generally considered the greatest figure of 20th-century <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">developmental psychology</span></b>; he was the first to perform rigorous studies of the way in which <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">children</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">learn</span></b> and come to understand and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">respond</span></b> to the world around them.  He is most famous for his theory of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">four stages of development</span></b>:  sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational.  His most famous works are <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Language and Thought of a Child</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">The Origins of Intelligence in Children</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Erik Erikson</span></b> (German-born American, 1902\u20131994): Erik Erikson is best known for his theories on how <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">social institutions reflect the universal features of psychosocial development</span></b>; in particular, how different societies create different traditions and ideas to accommodate the same biological needs.  He created a notable <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">eight-stage development process</span></b> and wrote several <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cpsychohistories\u201d</span></b> explaining how people like Martin Luther and Mahatma Gandhi were able to think and act the way they did.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Abraham Maslow</span></b> (American, 1908\u20131970): Abraham Maslow is principally known for two works, <i class=\"ygk-term\">Motivation and Personality</i> and <i class=\"ygk-term\">Toward a Psychology of Being</i>, that introduced his theory of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">hierarchy of needs</span></b> (food, shelter, love, esteem, etc.) and its pinnacle, the need for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">self-actualization</span></b>.  Self-actualized people are those who understand their individual needs and abilities and who have families, friends, and colleagues that support them and allow them to accomplish things on which they place value.  The lowest unmet need on the hierarchy tends to dominate conscious thought.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Stanley Milgram</span></b> (American, 1933\u20131984): Though he did the work that created the idea of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201csix degrees of separation\u201d</span></b> and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201clost-letter\u201d technique</span></b>, he is mainly remembered for his experiments on <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">obedience to authority</span></b> that he performed at Yale in 1961\u20131962.  Milgram found that two thirds of his subjects were willing to administer terrible <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">electric shocks</span></b> to innocent, protesting human beings simply because a researcher told them the experimental protocol demanded it.</li>"
