This model was the basis for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Johann Balmer</span></b>\u2019s work with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">spectroscopy</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Johannes Rydberg</span></b>\u2019s energy formula, which explicitly stated the frequency of light that an electron would emit if it went from a higher energy to a lower energy.  Bohr and his son fled to the U.S. in World War\u00a0II under the pseudonym \u201cBaker,\u201d and contributed to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Manhattan Project</span></b>.</li>",

In opposition to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics</span></b>, de\u00a0Broglie later worked to define a purely <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">causal interpretation</span></b>, but his work remained unfinished until <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">David Bohm</span></b> refined it in the 1950s.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Albert Einstein</span></b> (1879\u20131955) In one year \u2014 1905, called his <i class=\"ygk-term\">annus mirabilis</i>, or \u201cmiracle year\u201d \u2014 Albert Einstein authored four papers that revolutionized modern physics.  The first explained the <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mod2.html\">photoelectric effect</a> in terms of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quantized</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">electromagnetic radiation</span></b>.  The second formed the foundation for modern <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">statistical physics</span></b> by explaining the seemingly-random motion of particles in a fluid, a behavior called <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/152.mf1i.spring02/BrownianMotion.htm\">Brownian motion</a>.  The third reconciled <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Maxwellian electrodynamics</span></b> with classical mechanics by positing a finite, constant <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">speed of light</span></b>, a theory now known as <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/SpecialRelativity.html\">special relativity</a>.  The fourth paper contained his statement that the energy of a body is equal to its mass times the speed of light squared (that is, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\"><i>E</i>\u00a0=\u00a0<i>m</i><i>c</i><sup>2</sup></span></b>).  Ten years later, in 1915, Einstein published his theory of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">general relativity</span></b>, which generalized special relativity to account for <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gravitational fields</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Enrico Fermi</span></b> (1901\u20131954) Fermi is best known to the public as a main contributor to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Manhattan Project</span></b>.  His work with statistical physics laid the groundwork for modern electronics and solid-state technologies.  He applied the <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/pauli.html\">Pauli exclusion principle</a> to subatomic particles to create <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/disfd.html\">Fermi-Dirac statistics</a>, which accurately predicted the low-temperature behavior of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">electrons</span></b>.  Particles that obey Fermi-Dirac statistics are called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fermions</span></b> in his honor.  Fermi also suggested the existence of the <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://www.ps.uci.edu/~superk/neutrino.html\">neutrino</a> in order to balance nuclear <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">beta-decay</span></b> chains.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Richard Feynman</span></b> (1918\u20131988). Feynman developed a mathematical formalism called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">path integral formulation of quantum theory</span></b> that utilized the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201csum over histories,\u201d</span></b> taking into account all possible paths a particle could take. This constituted the creation of <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics\">quantum electrodynamics</a> and earned him the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics.  He also used the sum over histories in developing <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/FeynmanDiagram.html\">Feynman diagrams</a>, which illustrate the interaction of subatomic particles.  Aside from being a prolific physicist, Feynman was also an accomplished <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bongo</span></b> player and sketch artist.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">George Gamow</span></b> (1904\u20131968) Gamow was one of the first to explain the implications of the <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang\">Big Bang theory</a> of cosmology.  He correctly predicted the abundance of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">hydrogen</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">helium</span></b> in the early universe, nicknamed <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Alpher-Bethe-Gamow theory</span></b> (an intentional pun on the first three letters of the Greek alphabet, alpha, beta, and gamma, for which the otherwise unrelated physicist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hans </span></b>Bethe was included), and also theorized that the the heat from the Big Bang would still be visible as the <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://aether.lbl.gov/www/science/cmb.html\">cosmic microwave background radiation</a>.  Although Gamow received no Nobel for this prediction, the CMB\u2019s discoverers, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Arno Penzias</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Robert Wilson</span></b>, as well as two later observers, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">John Mather</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">George Smoot</span></b>, did receive Nobels.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Werner Heisenberg</span></b> (1901\u20131976) Heisenberg is most known for his <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">matrix interpretation of quantum theory</span></b>, which constructs observable quantities as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">operators</span></b> that act on a system.  His famous <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/uncer.html\">uncertainty principle</a> (better translated, however, as \u201cindeterminacy principle\u201d) states that the more accurately an object\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">position</span></b> can be observed, the less accurately its <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">momentum</span></b> can.  This is because shorter wavelengths of light (used as a sort of measuring-stick) have higher energies, and disrupt a particle\u2019s momentum more strongly.  Heisenberg earned the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering the allotropic forms of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">hydrogen</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Max Planck</span></b> (1858\u20131947) Planck allowed quantum theory to move forward in the early 20th century by correctly modeling how an object radiates heat, solving the <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys314/lectures/bb/bb.html\">ultraviolet catastrophe</a>, which was a predicted unbounded increase in the amount of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">radiation</span></b> emitted at high frequencies.  <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Planck\u2019s Law of Radiation</span></b> superseded the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rayleigh-Jeans Law</span></b>.  He suggested that <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">electromagnetic energy</span></b> could only be emitted in specific packages, called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quanta</span></b> (singular <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quantum</span></b>, from the Latin for \u201chow much\u201d), positing that the energy of this photon was equal to its <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">frequency</span></b> times a fixed value <i>h</i>, now known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Planck\u2019s constant</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Ernest Rutherford</span></b> (1871\u20131937) Rutherford\u2019s <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/history/gold.html\">gold foil</a> experiment provided the first evidence that each <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">atom</span></b> is made up of a large, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">positively-charged</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">nucleus</span></b>, surrounded by a cloud of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">negatively-charged</span></b> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">electrons</span></b>.  Rutherford won the 1908 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work.  Rutherford was also an early leader in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">nuclear fission</span></b> techniques, having discovered the decay of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">carbon-14</span></b> and providing the impetus for modern <a class=\"ygk-term\" href=\"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nuclear/cardat.html\">carbon dating</a>.  As part of this research, he discovered the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">proton</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">neutron</span></b>, the latter in cooperation with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">James Chadwick</span></b>.  He is also the only native New Zealander with an element named after him (<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rutherfordium</span></b>, atomic number 104).</li>",

In addition to the main <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">isotope</span></b> (also called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">protium</span></b>), there are two other significant isotopes of hydrogen: <b><span class=\"label\">deuterium</span></b> (<sup>2</sup>H or D), which has one <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">neutron</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"label\">tritium</span></b> (<sup>3</sup>H or T), which has two neutrons. It naturally exists as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diatomic gas</span></b> (H<sub>2</sub>), which was discovered by the British chemist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Henry Cavendish</span></b>. Hydrogen is highly <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">flammable</span></b> when exposed to high temperatures or electric current, a fact demonstrated by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hindenburg disaster</span></b>. It can react with nonmetals by losing an electron to form the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">H<sup>+</sup></span></b> ion, or react with metals to form the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">hydride ion</span></b>, H<sup>\u2013</sup>.</li>",

Discovered by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Sir William Ramsey</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pierre Janssen</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Norman Lockyer</span></b>, it has two stable isotopes, helium-3 and helium-4, with helium-4 by far the more common. Because of their different quantum properties (the helium-3 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">nucleus</span></b> is a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fermion</span></b>, while the helium-4 nucleus is a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">boson</span></b>), the isotopes of helium actually have significantly different physical properties. Helium-4 can exist in a zero-<b><span class=\"ygk-term\">viscosity</span></b> state known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">superfluidity</span></b> when its temperature drops below the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">lambda point</span></b>. Helium has the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">lowest boiling point</span></b> of any element; liquid helium is used for devices that need intense cooling, such as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">MRI machines</span></b>. Most helium on Earth results from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">radioactive decay</span></b>, since the helium nucleus is equivalent to an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">alpha particle</span></b>.</li>",

Diatomic oxygen is \u2014 despite having an even number of electrons \u2014 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">paramagnetic</span></b>, meaning it has unpaired electrons. This points out a problem with traditional <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">valence bond theories</span></b>, which predict that oxygen should be <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diamagnetic</span></b>; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">molecular orbital theory</span></b> correctly explains this behavior. Because oxygen is easily capable of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">accepting electrons</span></b>, reactions in which a species gives up electrons are known as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">oxidation reactions</span></b>.</li>",

Nitrogen, which was first isolated as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cnoxious air\u201d</span></b> by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Daniel Rutherford</span></b>, exists primarily as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diatomic molecule</span></b> containing two <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">triple-bonded</span></b> nitrogen atoms (N<sub>2</sub>). Because nitrogen gas is extremely <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">stable</span></b>, N<sub>2</sub> is unusable for many biological and chemical purposes. To make it useful, it often undergoes <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fixation</span></b> to convert it into usable nitrogen species such as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ammonium ion</span></b> (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) \u2014 as it is by bacteria in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">root nodules</span></b> of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">legume</span></b> plants\u2014or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ammonia</span></b> gas (NH<sub>3</sub>), as is done industrially in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Haber-Bosch process</span></b>. Conversely, its stability makes it useful in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">preventing unwanted combustion reactions</span></b>. It also has a relatively <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">low boiling point</span></b> (\u2013196\u00b0C), which makes liquid nitrogen useful as a refrigerant.</li>",

Older names for it, reflecting its liquid nature, include <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">hydrargyrum</span></b> (the source of its symbol) and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quicksilver</span></b>. Because it is a very <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dense</span></b> liquid, it is commonly used in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">barometers</span></b> to measure atmospheric pressure; the pressure exerted by the atmosphere equals the pressure exerted by a column containing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">760 millimeters</span></b> of mercury. Alloys of mercury with other metals are called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">amalgams</span></b>, some of which have been used as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dental fillings</span></b>. Chronic exposure to mercury can cause psychological problems; its use in hatmaking led to the expression <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cmad as a hatter.\u201d</span></b> More recently, concerns about mercury exposure have led to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">banning</span></b> of mercury in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">thermometers</span></b>.</li>",

Its most stable <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">allotrope</span></b> is an eight-membered ring that exists as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">yellow solid</span></b>. It is most often isolated by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">injecting superheated steam</span></b> into the ground in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Frasch process</span></b>.

Iron can react with oxygen in the air to form <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">iron(III) oxide</span></b>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, in a relatively slow but <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">exothermic process</span></b>; this process is used in \u201call-day\u201d <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">heat patches</span></b>. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Hydrated</span></b> iron(III) oxide is better known as rust; rust only forms when iron is exposed to both oxygen <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">and</span></b> water. Its <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">isotope\u00a056</span></b> is one of the most strongly bound of all nuclei, with the lowest mass per nucleon.

Carbon\u2019s ability to form <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">four chemical bonds</span></b> means that it has many different <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">allotropes</span></b>. The best-characterized natural allotropes are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diamond</span></b>, which consists of a tetrahedral network of carbon atoms, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">graphite</span></b>, which consists of planes of carbon atoms arranged in hexagons. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Fullerenes</span></b> such as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">buckyballs</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">carbon nanotubes</span></b>, on the other hand, are generally produced synthetically; buckyballs are roughly spherical.

In other words, the voltage drop across a resistor (<i>V</i>) equals the current passing through the resistor (<i>I</i>) times the resistor\u2019s resistance (<i>R</i>).

A <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">potentiometer</span></b> is a rheostat with two terminals and a connection in the middle, so the middle terminal can set a precise, variable dividing point between the ends; therefore, a potentiometer can be used as a voltage divider.

The governing equation of a capacitor is <i>Q</i>\u00a0=\u00a0<i>C</i>\u2009\u0394<i>V</i>: the charge stored on the capacitor (<i>Q</i>, typically measured in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">coulombs</span></b>) equals the capacitor\u2019s capacitance (<i>C</i>, typically measured in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">farads</span></b>, or more likely in smaller units like microfarads) times the voltage across the capacitor (\u0394<i>V</i>).</p>\n<p>The total capacitance of a circuit depends on whether capacitors are arranged in parallel or series, but in the opposite fashion as for resistors: If two capacitors having capacitance <i>C</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> are placed in <em>parallel</em>, the total capacitance across them is <i>C</i>\u00a0=\u00a0<i>C</i><sub>1</sub>\u00a0+\u00a0<i>C</i><sub>2</sub>; if they are placed in <em>series</em>, then 1/<i>C</i>\u00a0=\u00a01/<i>C</i><sub>1</sub>\u00a0+1/\u00a0<i>C</i><sub>2</sub>.

When a solenoid is used in a circuit, it is called an inductor and serves to oppose changes in the current in the circuit. The strength of an inductor is its <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">inductance</span></b>, symbolized <i>L</i> and measured in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">henries</span></b> (after Joseph Henry, who discovered the principles of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">self-inductance</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mutual inductance</span></b>, though <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Michael Faraday</span></b> published his findings on electromagnetic induction first).</p>\n<p>The voltage across an inductor only depends on the change in current, so inductors are particularly used with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">alternating current</span></b>.

Because the flux in the core is constant, an alternating current in one coil produces a changing magnetic field, inducing an alternating current in the second coil. If the coils have different numbers of turns of wire (as is typical), the current in the second coil will have a different voltage than the current in the first coil. Therefore, transformers are used to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cstep up\u201d</span></b> or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cstep down\u201d</span></b> voltage, for example in power transmission lines and in adapters for household electronics.</p>\n</li>",

All mesons are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bosons</span></b>.  The quark and anti-quark must have the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">same color</span></b> (such as red and anti-red) so that the resulting meson is colorless (or \u201cwhite\u201d).  It is also possible to make mesons out of two (or more) quarks and the same number of anti-quarks, but this kind of particle (a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201ctetraquark\u201d</span></b>) is rare, both in nature and in quiz bowl.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Fermions</span></b> are particles with half-integral <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">spin</span></b>.  Spin is a form of \u201cintrinsic angular momentum,\u201d possessed by particles as if they were spinning around their axis (but they aren\u2019t).  The values cited for spin are not (usually) the real magnitude of that angular momentum, but the component of the angular momentum along one axis.  Quantum mechanics restricts that component to being <i>n</i>/2 times <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Planck\u2019s constant</span></b> divided by 2\u03c0 for some integer <i>n</i>.  If <i>n</i> is even, this results in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cintegral\u201d spin</span></b>, if it is odd, it results in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201chalf-integral\u201d spin</span></b>.  Note that the exact value of the spin itself is a real number; it\u2019s the multiplier of <i>h</i>/2\u03c0 that determines whether it is \u201cintegral\u201d or not.  The most significant thing about fermions is that they are subject to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pauli Exclusion Principle</span></b>:  No two fermions can have the same <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quantum numbers</span></b> (i.e., same state).  The name \u201cfermion\u201d comes from the name of the Italian-American physicist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Enrico Fermi</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Bosons</span></b> are particles with <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">integral spin</span></b>.  All particles are either bosons or fermions.  The spin of a composite particle is determined by the total spin (i.e., the component of its intrinsic angular momentum along one axis) of its particles.  For instance, an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">alpha particle</span></b> (two <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">protons</span></b> and two <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">neutrons</span></b>) has four half-integral spin values.  No matter how they are added up, the result will be an integral spin value (try it!), so an alpha particle is a (composite) boson.  The Pauli Exclusion Principle does <em>not</em> apply to bosons (in fact, bosons prefer to be in the same quantum state).  The name \u201cboson\u201d comes from the name of the Indian physicist <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Satyendra Nath Bose</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Hadrons</span></b> are any particles made out of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quarks</span></b> (alternatively, any particle affected by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">strong nuclear force</span></b>).  Generally, this means the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">baryons</span></b> and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mesons</span></b>.  All hadrons are colorless (in the sense of the combined color of their constituent quarks).  The name \u201chadron\u201d comes from the Greek for \u201cthick.\u201d</li>",

That is, forces result from particles emitting and absorbing gauge bosons.  The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">strong nuclear force</span></b> is carried by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gluons</span></b>, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">weak nuclear force</span></b> is carried by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">W</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Z<sup>\u2013</sup></span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Z<sup>+</sup> particles</span></b>, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">electromagnetic force</span></b> is carried by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">photon</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gravity</span></b> is carried by the (as yet unobserved) <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">graviton</span></b>.

                "<li>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Polynomials</span></b> are functions made of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">terms</span></b> added together, in which each term is a number times a product of variables raised to nonnegative-integer powers.  For instance, 3<i>x</i><sup>2</sup><i>y</i> and \u2013\u03c0<i>x</i><sup>7</sup><i>y</i><sup>2</sup><i>z</i><sup>3</sup> are each terms, so 3<i>x</i><sup>2</sup><i>y</i>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u03c0<i>x</i><sup>7</sup><i>y</i><sup>2</sup><i>z</i><sup>3</sup> is a polynomial.  (Individual terms are also considered polynomials.)  Much of math is concerned with polynomials involving only one variable, such as \u2013<i>x</i><sup>3</sup>\u00a0+\u00a02<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>.  The number at the beginning of each term is called a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">coefficient</span></b>.</p>\n<p>Since simple numbers (\u201cconstants\u201d) can also be written as the same number times any variable to the zeroth power (that is, 6 is the same as 6<i>x</i><sup>0</sup>), numbers are also considered terms and polynomials.  So <i>x</i>\u00a0+\u00a06 is a polynomial, as is just \u20134.</p>\n<p>Polynomials can be classified according to their number of terms: a polynomial with one term, like 2<i>x</i> or \u201312<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, is called a <b><span class=\"label\">monomial</span></b>; a polynomial with two terms is called a <b><span class=\"label\">binomial</span></b>; and a polynomial with three terms is called a <b><span class=\"label\">trinomial</span></b>.</p>\n<p>Each polynomial has a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">degree</span></b>.  For polynomials of one variable, the degree is the largest exponent on the variable, so for the polynomial 4<i>x</i><sup>3</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, the degree is 3.  For polynomials of multiple variables, to find the degree you calculate the sum of the variables\u2019 exponents on each term, then choose the largest such sum, so the degree of 3<i>x</i><sup>6</sup><i>y</i><sup>5</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<i>x</i><sup>2</sup><i>y</i><sup>3</sup> is calculated by adding 6+5\u00a0=\u00a011 for the first term and 2+3\u00a0=\u00a05 for the second and noting that 11 is larger, so the degree is 11.  A polynomial that is just a constant has degree 0.  A polynomial with degree 1, like 3<i>x</i>, is called <b><span class=\"label\">linear</span></b>; a polynomial with degree 2, like 3<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a08x\u00a0+\u00a04, is called <b><span class=\"label\">quadratic</span></b>; a polynomial with degree 3 is called <b><span class=\"label\">cubic</span></b>; continuing with increasing degrees, the terms are <b><span class=\"label\">quartic</span></b>, <b><span class=\"label\">quintic</span></b>, <b><span class=\"label\">sextic</span></b>, and so on, though terms corresponding to degrees larger than 5 are seldom used.  For technical reasons that are beyond the scope of this article, the zero polynomial (i.e., <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a00) is said to have a degree of \u2013\u221e or an undefined degree.</p>\n<p>The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fundamental theorem of algebra</span></b> is the statement that every single-variable polynomial, other than constants, has a root in the complex numbers, which means that if <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) is a polynomial, then the equation <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a00 has at least one solution where <i>x</i> is some complex number.</p>\n<p>There are formulas to find those roots for linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic polynomials, though the latter two formulas are extremely complicated.  The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Abel-Ruffini theorem</span></b>, also called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Abel\u2019s impossibility theorem</span></b>, is the statement that there is no way to find a formula for the solutions of all quintic or higher-degree polynomials, if the formula must be based on the traditional operations (addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, and exponentiation/taking roots).  That impossibility is the topic that began an area of study called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Galois <b><span class=\"pg\">gal-wah</span></b> theory</span></b>, which is part of abstract algebra.</p>\n</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Quadratics</span></b> are, as mentioned above, polynomials of degree 2.  The graph of a quadratic equation will be in the shape of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">parabola</span></b> that opens straight up (if the coefficient on the <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> term is positive) or straight down (if that coefficient is negative).  It is possible to find the roots of a quadratic by graphing it, factoring it, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">completing the square</span></b> on it, or using the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quadratic formula</span></b> (itself derived by completing the square) on it.  If the quadratic is in the form <i>a</i><i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0+\u00a0<i>b</i><i>x</i>\u00a0+\u00a0<i>c</i>, then the expression <i>b</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a04<i>a</i><i>c</i>, which appears in the quadratic formula, is called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">discriminant</span></b>.  If the discriminant is positive, the quadratic will have two real roots; if the discriminant is zero, the quadratic will have one real root (said to have a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">multiplicity</span></b> of 2); and if the discriminant is negative, the quadratic will have two non-real complex roots (and if the coefficients of the quadratic are real numbers, the complex roots will be <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">conjugates</span></b> of each other).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Rational functions</span></b> consist of one polynomial divided by another polynomial.  The denominator polynomial cannot be the zero polynomial, because dividing by zero is undefined. Examples therefore include 1/<i>x</i>, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>/(<i>x</i>\u00a0\u2013\u00a03), and (<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0+\u00a01)/(<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a01).  Every polynomial can be considered to be a rational function because 1 is a polynomial and dividing by 1 doesn\u2019t change an expression (so to consider the polynomial <i>x</i><sup>3</sup> as a rational function, think of it as <i>x</i><sup>3</sup>/1).  It is often instructive to study the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">asymptotes</span></b> of rational functions, which are places in which their graphs approach a line (or occasionally other shape), usually getting infinitely close to but not crossing it.  That analysis may require performing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">long division</span></b> on the numerator and denominator polynomials to find their <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">greatest common factor</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Periodic functions</span></b> are those whose graph repeats a pattern (specifically, the graph has <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">translational symmetry</span></b>).  Technically speaking, a function of one variable <i>f</i> is periodic if <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>+<i>p</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) for every <i>x</i> in the domain of the function and some positive number <i>p</i>, which is called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">period</span></b>, because the graph repeats itself every <i>p</i>\u00a0units.  While the trigonometric functions are the periodic functions most commonly encountered by high school math students, some other functions like triangle waves are also periodic; in general, functions representing waves tend to be periodic.  A <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Fourier <b><span class=\"pg\">fur-ee-ay</span></b> series</span></b> is a way to rewrite (almost) any periodic function in terms of only sine and cosine functions.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">trigonometric functions</span></b> represent relations between angles and sides of triangles.  They are often illustrated using points and segments related to a circle of radius\u00a01 centered at the origin, called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unit circle</span></b>.  By far the most commonly discussed trigonometric functions are the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sine</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cosine</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tangent</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cosecant</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">secant</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cotangent</span></b> functions.  There are <i>many</i> interesting relationships between these: the graphs of sine and cosine are translations of each other; the tangent function equals the sine function divided by the cosine function; the cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions are the reciprocals of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions, respectively; and there are many other relationships called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">trigonometric identities</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">inverse trigonometric functions</span></b> are, as one might expect, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">inverse functions</span></b> of the trigonometric functions.  (Note that \u201cinverse\u201d in this case refers to a function that \u201cundoes\u201d another, not to \u201cmultiplicative inverse,\u201d also called \u201creciprocal.\u201d)  They are sometimes just called \u201cinverse sine,\u201d etc, and are also given with the prefix \u201carc\u201d: <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arcsine</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arccosine</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arctangent</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arccosecant</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arcsecant</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arccotangent</span></b>.  They are sometimes notated in the form sin<sup>\u20131</sup> for arcsine, but that notation can be confusing, so NAQT tends to prefer \u201carcsine,\u201d etc.  Because the trigonometric functions are not bijective (see below), to have inverses it is necessary to restrict the domains of the inverse trigonometric functions; for instance, arcsin(<i>x</i>) is only defined for <i>x</i> between \u20131 and 1, inclusive.</li>",
                "<li>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Injective functions</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"label\">injections</span></b>, are functions that do not repeat any outputs.  For instance, <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a02<i>x</i> is injective, because for every possible output value, there is only one input that will result in that output.  On the other hand, <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0sin(<i>x</i>) is <em>not</em> injective, because (for instance) the output 0 can be obtained from several different inputs (0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, and so on).  If you have the graph of a function, you can determine whether the function is injective by applying the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">horizontal line test</span></b>:  if no horizontal line would ever intersect the graph twice, the function is injective.</p>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Surjective functions</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"label\">surjections</span></b>, are functions that achieve every possible output.  For instance, if you are thinking of functions whose domain and codomain are both the set of all real numbers, then <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0tan(<i>x</i>) is surjective, because every real number is an output for some input.  But <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> is not surjective, because (for instance) \u20133 is not an output for any real-number input.  The term <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">image</span></b> is sometimes used for the set of all output values that a function actually achieves; a surjective function, then, is one whose image equals its codomain.</p>\n<p>A function that is both injective and surjective is called <b><span class=\"label\">bijective</span></b>, or a <b><span class=\"label\">bijection</span></b>.  If a function is bijective, then it has an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">inverse</span></b>.  Furthermore, a function can <em>only</em> have an inverse if it is bijective.</p>\n</li>",
                "<li>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Even functions</span></b> satisfy the rule <i>f</i>(\u2013<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) for every <i>x</i> in the domain of the function.  The graph of an even function has reflection symmetry over the <i>y</i>-axis.  Even functions are so named because if a polynomial\u2019s exponents (on the variable) are all even, then the polynomial is an even function; for instance, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, 3<i>x</i><sup>6</sup>, and \u2013<i>x</i><sup>8</sup>\u00a0+\u00a07<i>x</i><sup>4</sup> are all even.  There are other even functions, though, such as the cosine and absolute value functions.</p>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Odd functions</span></b> satisfy the rule <i>f</i>(\u2013<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0\u2013<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) for every <i>x</i> in the domain of the function.  The graph of an odd function remains the same when it is rotated 180\u00b0 around the origin.  Odd functions are so named because if a polynomial\u2019s exponents (on the variable) are all odd, then the polynomial is an odd function; for instance, <i>x</i><sup>3</sup>, 4<i>x</i><sup>7</sup>, and \u2013<i>x</i><sup>5</sup>\u00a0+\u00a02<i>x</i><sup>3</sup> are all odd.  There are other odd functions, such as the sine and cube root functions.</p>\n<p>Many functions are neither even nor odd, such as <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0+\u00a0<i>x</i>.  Only one function is both even and odd: the zero function, <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a00.</p>\n</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Exponential functions</span></b> are those of the form <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0<i>b</i><sup><i>x</i></sup>, where <i>b</i> (called the base) is a positive number other than 1. Exponential functions are used to model unrestricted <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">growth</span></b> (such as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">compound interest</span></b>, and animal <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">populations</span></b> with unlimited food and no predators) and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">decay</span></b> (such as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">radioactive decay</span></b>).  The phrase \u201c<em>the</em> exponential function\u201d refers to the function <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0<i>e</i><sup><i>x</i></sup>, where <i>e</i> is a specific irrational number called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Euler\u2019s number</span></b>, about equal to 2.718.  Exponential functions have the interesting property that their <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">derivatives</span></b> are proportional to themselves.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Logarithmic functions</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"label\">logarithms</span></b>, are functions of the form <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0log<sub><i>b</i></sub><i>x</i>, where <i>b</i> is again a positive number other than 1 (and again called the base).  They are the inverses of the exponential functions with the same bases.  Logarithmic functions are used to model <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sensory perception</span></b> and some phenomena in probability and statistics.  The phrase \u201c<em>the</em> logarithm\u201d can refer to a logarithmic function using the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">base\u00a02</span></b> (especially in computer science; this is also called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">binary logarithm</span></b>), <i>e</i> (especially in higher math), or 10 (especially in lower levels of math and physical sciences). The phrase <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">natural logarithm</span></b> refers to the logarithm base\u00a0<i>e</i>, and the phrase <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">common logarithm</span></b> usually refers to the logarithm base\u00a010.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Continuous functions</span></b>, studied in calculus, are functions where the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">limit</span></b> approaching each point equals the function\u2019s value at that point.

Continuity is often explained as a function\u2019s graph being drawable in one motion without lifting the writing utensil from the paper.  All polynomials are continuous, as are the sine and cosine functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">absolute value function</span></b>.  Some examples of non-continuous functions are many rational functions, as they often have holes or asymptotes; the tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions, which have asymptotes; and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">floor and ceiling functions</span></b>, which have jumps.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Differentiable functions</span></b>, also studied in calculus, are functions for which the derivative can be found (because a particular limit, called a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">difference quotient</span></b>, exists).  Like continuity, differentiability is really a property of a specific point, and a differentiable function is one that is differentiable at every point.  Every differentiable function is continuous, but some continuous functions are not differentiable; mathematicians thus say that differentiability is a stronger property than continuity.  In terms of graphs, a differentiable function has a \u201csmooth\u201d graph with no <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">corners</span></b> or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cusps</span></b> (and also, because continuity is required, no holes, jumps, or asymptotes).  All polynomials are differentiable, as are the sine and cosine functions, and exponential and logarithmic functions.  However, the absolute value function <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0|<i>x</i>| is not differentiable because it has a \u201ccorner\u201d at <i>x</i>\u00a0=\u00a00 (but recall that it is still continuous).</li>"

However, in 2006, it was reclassified as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dwarf planet</span></b> due to its inability to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">clear the neighborhood</span></b> of its orbit (meaning there are other bodies of comparable size that share its orbit). Pluto was discovered by 24-year-old astronomer <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Clyde Tombaugh</span></b>, who found it by looking at whether or not objects had moved in subsequent photos of the same area of the sky. Pluto was visited by NASA\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">New Horizons</i> probe (which carried Tombaugh\u2019s ashes) in 2015; among its most striking features was a heart-shaped area in its southern hemisphere, which was christened the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tombaugh Regio</span></b>. Pluto is part of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kuiper belt</span></b>, a disk of outer Solar System objects ranging from around 30\u201350\u00a0AU from the Sun.

The fame of Halley\u2019s Comet rests on two main factors: first, it has a relatively short orbital period of about <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">75.5 years</span></b>; second, it is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">visible to the naked eye</span></b> as it passes Earth. The comet is named after <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Edmond Halley</span></b> (1656\u20131742), who observed it in 1682, determined it orbited the Sun, and correctly predicted its subsequent 1758 return in his treatise <i>Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets</i>. Halley\u2019s Comet is one of the most studied and depicted astronomical objects in all of human history: Chinese reports of the comet\u2019s appearance in 240\u00a0BC are part of the <i>Records of the Grand Historian</i>, and the comet appears in the sky of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bayeux Tapestry</span></b>, as it passed Earth in 1066 before the Battle of Hastings. Halley\u2019s Comet is the source of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Orionid meteor shower</span></b>.</li>",

Hale\u2013Bopp was an extremely bright comet, reaching a peak magnitude of \u22121.8 (smaller numbers indicate greater luminosity). The comet was named for its American co-discoverers, Alan Hale (a professional astronomer), and Thomas Bopp (an amateur stargazer). The comet\u2019s 1990s pass through the solar system greatly affected its orbit: a close encounter with the planet <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Jupiter</span></b> and its gravitational pull shifted the comet\u2019s path such that its orbital period dropped from over 4,000 years to about 2,500 years. During its visible time, astronomers discovered that Hale\u2013Bopp had a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sodium tail</span></b>. Members of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Heaven\u2019s Gate cult</span></b> killed themselves in a 1997 mass suicide in an attempt to board a spaceship they believed was hidden by the comet.</li>",

The comet was named for its co-discoverers, husband and wife Gene and Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy. Shoemaker\u2013Levy\u00a09 was discovered in 1993, when it had already been captured by Jupiter\u2019s gravity and had passed the planet\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Roche limit</span></b>, the point at which a larger body\u2019s tidal forces become so powerful that a smaller body will break up. The comet\u2019s fragments collided with Jupiter in July. Subsequent observations of the clouds around the impact site revealed deeper layers of Jupiter\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">atmosphere</span></b> never before seen; astronomers confirmed the existence of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sulfur</span></b>, but were disappointed by lack of evidence for a theorized layer of water clouds.

In 2014, the European Space Agency\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Rosetta</i> probe reached the comet, ten years after it was launched in 2004. Two months after Rosetta began to orbit the comet, its <i class=\"ygk-term\">Philae</i> lander touched down on the comet\u2019s surface on November 12, marking the first time any human spacecraft had successfully landed on a comet\u2019s nucleus. However, an accident in the landing meant that Philae landed in a spot where it could not receive solar power, and its batteries ran out after just two days of work.

Ceres was discovered by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Giuseppe Piazzi</span></b>, an Italian priest and astronomer, in 1801, making it the first asteroid belt object to be observed and documented; it was named after the Roman goddess of agriculture. The discovery of Ceres involved the collaboration of multiple scientists, including <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Carl Friedrich Gauss</span></b>, whose calculations of Ceres\u2019s orbital path allowed it to be found again after it was lost due to the Sun. In 2006, with the demotion of Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet, Ceres was also reclassified as a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dwarf planet</span></b>, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. In 2015, NASA\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Dawn</i> probe reached Ceres, beginning an extended observation. Ceres\u2019s surface features include <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Ahuna Mons</span></b>, a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cryovolcano</span></b> that erupts aqueous solutions, which quickly freeze upon exposure to Ceres\u2019s cold surface.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Vesta</span></b> (formally, 4\u00a0Vesta) is the second-most massive object in the asteroid belt, after Ceres. Vesta was discovered by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Heinrich Olbers</span></b>, who also discovered the asteroid <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pallas</span></b> (which is approximately as large as Vesta, but less massive); it was named by Carl Friedrich Gauss after the Roman goddess of the hearth. Vesta\u2014like Ceres\u2014was visited by the <i>Dawn</i> probe, which orbited Vesta from 2011 to 2012 before leaving orbit and heading for Ceres. Notable features of Vesta include the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Rheasilvia crater</span></b>, an enormous impact crater whose diameter is over 90% of the diameter of Vesta itself and at whose center is a mountain over 12\u00a0miles tall.

Eris is a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">scattered disc object</span></b>, meaning it was \u201cscattered\u201d out of the Kuiper belt by the gravity of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Neptune</span></b>, falling into a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">high-eccentricity orbit</span></b> that ranges between 38 and 97\u00a0AU from the Sun. Upon its discovery, Eris was thought to be both larger and more massive than Pluto; later observations concluded Pluto did have a greater surface area, but was less massive. Eris\u2019s discovery and its potential classification as another planet prompted the 2006 IAU redefinition of the term \u201cplanet\u201d that excluded Pluto (and Eris). Eris was named after the Greek goddess of strife, in acknowledgment that its discovery had caused a great deal of strife within astronomy. Eris is orbited by the moon <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dysnomia</span></b>.</li>",

Evidence for the existence of Theia\u2014and its collision with Earth\u2014include observations of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">shock heating</span></b> in meteorites of approximately the same age as the hypothesized impact and the fact that the Earth is much more abundant in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">light chlorine</span></b>, while the Moon contains more <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">heavy chlorine</span></b>\u2014a result that fits with what would be expected if two objects collided, broke apart, and re-formed. In 2021, scientists at Arizona State University proposed that the Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces found in the lowest part of Earth\u2019s mantle may be remnants of Theia.

Receding seas led to the prevalence of lowland <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">swamps</span></b>, which were filled with lignin-rich trees and numerous ferns. These extensive forests sequestered carbon dioxide, leading to an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">increase in atmospheric oxygen levels</span></b> to about 35%, as compared to 21% today. High oxygen levels may have led to <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">gigantism</span></b> in insects; millipedes grew to over 8\u00a0feet long and dragonflies had wingspans of 30\u00a0inches. The Carboniferous is also known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Age of Amphibians</span></b>, as tetrapods became the dominant terrestrial animals and began to diversify. The first <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">amniotes</span></b> appeared, as well as the first <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">reptiles</span></b>. Landmasses including the southern continent Gondwana and the northern continent Laurasia collided to form the supercontinent <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Pangaea</span></b>, which was surrounded by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Panthalassic Ocean</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Permian Period</span></b> (299\u00a0mya to 252\u00a0mya) saw a decline of the swamps of and rainforests that dominated the Carboniferous and an increase in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">deserts</span></b> throughout the interior of Pangaea. Amniotes were able to cope with the prevalent dry climates, and two amniotic groups\u2014the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">synapsids</span></b> (ancestors of modern mammals) and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sauropsids</span></b> (reptiles)\u2014greatly diversified. The end of the Permian was marked by the Permian Mass Extinction (also known as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Great Dying</span></b>), the largest mass extinction in Earth\u2019s history; over 90% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species went extinct. The extinction is thought to have been caused by an eruption of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Siberian Traps</span></b>, a large igneous province that released massive amounts of lava and noxious gasses. The outgassing of carbon dioxide led to severe <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">global warming</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ocean acidification</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">anoxia</span></b>. All large synapsids went extinct, leaving an ecological void.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Triassic Period</span></b> (252\u00a0mya to 201\u00a0mya) was the first period of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mesozoic Era</span></b>. A specialized group of reptiles called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">archosaurs</span></b> underwent adaptive radiation to fill the voids left by the Permian Mass Extinction. The dominant group of archosaurs was the pseudosuchians, ancestors of modern crocodiles. Another group of archosaurs, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dinosaurs</span></b>, first appeared, as well as the first true <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">mammals</span></b>. The climate of the Triassic was hot and dry, but became humid as Pangaea began to break up near the end of the period. The period ended with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Triassic Mass Extinction</span></b>, which wiped out about 75% of species. Marine invertebrates were hit particularly hard, but large pseudosuchians and amphibians also went extinct, paving the way for the rise of the dinosaurs.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Jurassic Period</span></b> (201\u00a0mya to 145\u00a0mya) was the first to be dominated by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">dinosaurs</span></b>. The climate was <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">warm</span></b>; there were no ice caps and forests stretched to the poles. Many of the most well-known dinosaurs from the Jurassic Period are known from the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Morrison Formation</span></b> in Colorado, including Allosaurus, Stegosaurus, Brontosaurus, Diplodocus, and Apatosaurus. Archaeopteryx, a transitional species between dinosaurs and birds, was discovered in the Jurassic-age <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Solnhofen Limestone</span></b> in Germany. The skies were ruled by flying reptiles called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pterosaurs</span></b>, and the oceans were dominated by marine reptiles, including ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">Cretaceous Period</span></b> (145\u00a0mya to 66\u00a0mya) was similar to the Jurassic. The climate was still warm, with numerous shallow inland seas. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dinosaurs</span></b> continued to dominate, and mammals and birds continued to diversify. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Angiosperms</span></b>, or flowering plants, appeared for the first time and quickly became the dominant group of plants on Earth. North America was split lengthwise by the Western Interior Seaway, which was dominated by marine reptiles called mosasaurs. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs that walked the land included Tyrannosaurus, Velociraptor, and Triceratops. The Cretaceous Period, and the Mesozoic Era, ended with the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cretaceous-Paleogene Mass Extinction</span></b>. A worldwide layer of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">iridium</span></b> dated to 66\u00a0mya sparked the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u00c1lvarez Hypothesis</span></b>, which posited that the extinction was caused by a huge impact event. This idea was strongly supported by the discovery of the massive <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Chicxulub crater</span></b> on the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula. 75% of all species went extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs and large terrestrial animals.</li>",

During the initial Paleogene Period (66\u00a0mya to 23\u00a0mya), mammals diversified and grew in size to become the dominant land animals, filling the void left by the previous mass extinction. Temperatures were high at the beginning of the period, peaking at the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum</span></b> (PETM), but cooled down during the Oligocene epoch as Antarctica froze. During the Neogene Period (23\u00a0mya to 2.6\u00a0mya), landmasses settled close to their modern positions.

The irrational constant <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">pi</span></b> can be defined as the ratio of the circle\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">circumference</span></b> (the circle-specific term for perimeter) to its <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">diameter</span></b> (equal to twice the radius); the circle\u2019s area is pi times the radius squared. A <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sector</span></b> is the wedge-like shape bounded by two radii and an arc of the circumference; a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">chord</span></b> is a straight line segment joining two points on the circumference. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Cyclic shapes</span></b> are shapes for which it is possible to draw a circle that goes through all the shape\u2019s vertices; all triangles and all rectangles (including squares) are cyclic, but many quadrilaterals are not.

Another definition of conic sections is that, for any point <i>P</i> on the curve, the distance from <i>P</i> to a point called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">focus</span></b> is equal to a constant multiple of the distance from <i>P</i> to a line called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">directrix</span></b>; the constant multiple is the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">eccentricity</span></b>, a dimensionless number that describes how \u201csquashed\u201d the curve is or how far away it is from being a circle. For example, for a circle, the focus is the center, the directrix is a \u201cline at infinity,\u201d and the eccentricity is therefore zero.

For example, the limit of 1/<i>x</i> as <i>x</i> gets infinity large (\u201capproaches infinity\u201d) is 0, even though the function never actually reaches 0.

Properly, a function is continuous at a given point if the function has a limit at that point and is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">equal to its limit</span></b> there. It is also common to speak of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201ccontinuous functions,\u201d</span></b> which are functions that are continuous at every point. Polynomials are continuous, as are exponential and logarithmic functions, sine, and cosine. However, the other four trigonometric functions (cosecant, secant, tangent, and cotangent) are not continuous at some points (the ones at which their graphs have asymptotes), and rational functions generally have some points of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">discontinuity</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The derivative</span></b> is an operation that takes a function and results in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">another function</span></b> that gives the original function\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">rate of change</span></b>. Taking a derivative is called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">differentiation</span></b> and is carried out with respect to the input variable that is changing. The derivative is calculated as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">limit of a tangent line</span></b> between two points on the function\u2019s graph as the two points get arbitrarily close together. At any given point, the derivative\u2019s value is equal to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">slope of the tangent line</span></b> to the function\u2019s graph at that point. The derivative of a function <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) is notated as <i>f</i>\u2032(<i>x</i>) (Lagrange\u2019s notation, pronounced \u201c<i>f</i> prime of <i>x</i>\u201d) or d<i>f</i>/d<i>x</i> (Leibniz notation, pronounced \u201cd <i>f</i> d <i>x</i>).

Differentiability is a stronger property than continuity: a function can only be differentiable if it is continuous, but it could be only continuous and not differentiable (the absolute value function being an example of that).

Sometimes an algorithm calls itself to solve a smaller case of the problem, until it reaches a simple <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">base case</span></b> that is already solved. For example, a recursive algorithm to calculate <i>n</i>\u00a0factorial uses the fact that <i>n</i>!\u00a0=\u00a0<i>n</i>\u00b7(<i>n</i>\u22121)!, so it calls itself on <i>n</i>\u22121 and keeps going with smaller values until it reaches the base case of 1!, which is just 1.</p>\n<p><b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tail recursion</span></b> is the use of recursion as the last step of an algorithm.

In visual representations, the vertices are shown as dots, with edges shown as lines between the two vertices they connect.

                "<li>A <b><span class=\"label\">programming language</span></b> is a way to write algorithms and other instructions in a way that can (usually after additional steps) be understood and executed by a computer. Almost all programming languages have ways of defining <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">variables</span></b>, which hold data, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">functions</span></b>, which are sets of instructions that achieve some task (such as performing an algorithm). <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Java</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">JavaScript</span></b> (which is not the same as Java), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">C</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">C++</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Python</span></b> are common programming languages. Programming languages can be categorized by their <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">paradigm</span></b> (which is a general sense of how the code tends to be structured), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">typing</span></b> (see below), how they are run (compiled or interpreted), and in other ways.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Object-oriented programming</span></b> is a programming paradigm that involves the creation of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">objects</span></b> from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">classes</span></b> that can hold data and transform it in various ways. A class is a definition of the fundamental properties than an object has, while objects are specific examples of a class (for instance, the general idea of a dog is a class, while your pet dog would be an object.) <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Inheritance</span></b> allows subclasses to be defined so that the properties of a parent class are present in the sub-class (for example, \u201cschnauzer\u201d might be a subclass of \u201cdog\u201d). In <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">composition</span></b>, an object contains or references another object (which might or might not be of the same class, e.g., a dog\u2019s digestive system might be another object). Object-oriented programming also often uses <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">encapsulation</span></b> to hide unnecessary details from other aspects, e.g., a dog\u2019s digestive system doesn\u2019t need to know about its circulatory system. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Polymorphism</span></b> is the idea that different classes may be able to do the same things in potentially different ways, e.g., animals all eat but they do so in different ways. Java and C++ are object-oriented languages.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Functional programming</span></b> is a paradigm based on the execution of various functions to calculate values. Functions in pure functional programming are free of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">side effects</span></b>, meaning that they do not change the program state but only compute values. Functional languages use <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">currying</span></b> to evaluate functions with multiple inputs. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ML</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Haskell</span></b> are functional programming languages.</li>",
                "<li>A <b><span class=\"label\">compiler</span></b> is used with many programming languages to convert human-readable code into instructions that a machine can execute. C and C++ programs are often compiled by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">GCC</span></b> into code specific for the machine the compiler is running on. Java\u2019s compiler instead compiles into a less specific format called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bytecode</span></b>, which is executed by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Java Virtual Machine</span></b> (JVM). Since compiled Java can be run on any machine with a JVM, Java is referred to as \u201cwrite once, run anywhere.\u201d Some languages are not compiled before running but instead have their code turned into machine instructions as they run, such as JavaScript and Python; these languages are called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">interpreted</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li>\n<p>A language\u2019s <b><span class=\"label\">typing</span></b> refers to how the type of data a variable holds is defined and can or can\u2019t change. Common types of variables are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">booleans</span></b>, which can only be true or false; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">strings</span></b>, which hold text; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">integers</span></b>; and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">floats</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">doubles</span></b>, which hold non-integer numbers.</p>\n<p>In <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">statically typed languages</span></b>, a variable is given a type the first time it is used and can\u2019t be changed; compilers check that all variables have the correct types while the program is compiling, which helps catch errors but also makes some tasks more difficult. Java, C, and C++ have static typing.</p>\n<p><b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dynamically typed languages</span></b> do not check types when compiling, which makes some tasks easier, but type errors (e.g., trying to multiply two strings) can occur while the program is running. Python and JavaScript are dynamically typed.</p>\n<p>Some languages support <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">duck typing</span></b>, which is sort of intermediate between static and dynamic typing. Duck typing essentially allows objects to do the same or similar things even if their classes have no formal relation.

The worst-case situations are expressed using <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">big\u00a0O notation</span></b>; for example, if an algorithm to sort a list of <i>n</i>\u00a0items might need up to <i>n</i><sup>2</sup> to sort the list, the algorithm\u2019s worst-case time complexity is <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>). (This is a simplification of the mathematics of asymptotic notation.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Recursion</span></b> is a technique used in some algorithms. Sometimes an algorithm calls itself to solve a smaller case of the problem, until it reaches a simple <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">base case</span></b> that is already solved. For example, a recursive algorithm to calculate <i>n</i>\u00a0factorial uses the fact that <i>n</i>!\u00a0=\u00a0<i>n</i>\u00b7(<i>n</i>\u22121)!, so it calls itself on <i>n</i>\u22121 and keeps going with smaller values until it reaches the base case of 1!, which is just 1.</p>\n<p><b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Tail recursion</span></b> is the use of recursion as the last step of an algorithm. Algorithms that use tail recursion are often more optimized by compilers. Recursive algorithms can have their big\u00a0O runtime calculated by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Master theorem</span></b>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A <b><span class=\"label\">graph</span></b> is a mathematical concept often used in algorithms, in which a set of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">vertices</span></b> is connected by a set of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">edges</span></b>. In visual representations, the vertices are shown as dots, with edges shown as lines between the two vertices they connect. A <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">path</span></b> between two vertices is a sequence of edges that starts at the first vertex and ends at the last. A <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cycle</span></b> is a path that begins and ends at the same vertex.</p>\n<p>A graph is called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">weighted</span></b> if every edge has a number representing the \u201ccost\u201d of traveling the edge; weighted graphs are used, for example, in analyzing navigation, with vertices representing cities, edges representing roads between them, and weights representing distance (or travel time). A graph is called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">directed</span></b> if each edge has an inherent direction (an edge going from vertex\u00a0<i>A</i> to vertex\u00a0<i>B</i>, but not from <i>B</i> to <i>A</i>), e.g., representing a one-way road</p>\n<p>Graphs are also called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">networks</span></b>, and this is the origin of the term <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">social network</span></b>: if vertices represent people and edges represent who knows whom, a social network is a graph of a collection of people and the relationships between them.</p>\n<p>Graphs are used to organize data (often in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">trees</span></b>, which are graphs in which you can reach any vertex from any other vertex, but there are no cycles), analyze navigation/travel (broadly construed, such as the flow of fluid in a complex pipe system), manage tasks and scheduling (with edges representing dependencies), and more.</p>\n<p><b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm</span></b> is used to find the shortest path between two vertices of a graph (possibly a weighted graph, in which case \u201cshortest\u201d means least total weight). <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Prim\u2019s algorithm</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Kruskal\u2019s algorithm</span></b> are used to find a graph\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">minimum spanning tree</span></b>, that is a tree connecting all its vertices whose edges have the smallest possible total weight.</p>\n</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Divide-and-conquer algorithms</span></b> use recursion to split problems into smaller subproblems with smaller input sets. By solving the same problem on each of these subproblems, then combining the outputs in some way, a divide-and-conquer algorithm can efficiently solve problems on big input sets. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Merge sort</span></b> (a sorting algorithm), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">binary search</span></b> (an algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list), and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Karatsuba\u2019s algorithm</span></b> (an algorithm for multiplying integers) are examples of divide-and-conquer algorithms.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Greedy algorithms</span></b> are algorithms that make the locally optimum or \u201cbest\u201d choice at every step. Such algorithms may or may not produce an overall best solution. Consider an algorithm for making change in which you pick the largest coin smaller than or equal to the amount of change you need to give. If you need to give 7\u00a2 change, you first pick a nickel (5\u00a2) and still have to make 2\u00a2 change, so you pick a penny (1\u00a2) and still have to make 1\u00a2, so you add an additional penny and have broken the 7\u00a2 into 5\u00a2\u00a0+\u00a01\u00a2\u00a0+\u00a01\u00a2. In the U.S. coin system, this is optimal in the sense of using as few coins as possible, namely three coins. However, in a coin system that offered coins worth 1\u00a2, 3\u00a2, 4\u00a2, and 5\u00a2, the greedy algorithm would give the same solution, even though a solution with fewer coins is possible (4\u00a2\u00a0+\u00a03\u00a2).</li>\n<li>A <b><span class=\"label\">programming language</span></b> is a way to write algorithms and other instructions in a way that can (usually after additional steps) be understood and executed by a computer. Almost all programming languages have ways of defining <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">variables</span></b>, which hold data, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">functions</span></b>, which are sets of instructions that achieve some task (such as performing an algorithm). <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Java</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">JavaScript</span></b> (which is not the same as Java), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">C</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">C++</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Python</span></b> are common programming languages. Programming languages can be categorized by their <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">paradigm</span></b> (which is a general sense of how the code tends to be structured), <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">typing</span></b> (see below), how they are run (compiled or interpreted), and in other ways.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Object-oriented programming</span></b> is a programming paradigm that involves the creation of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">objects</span></b> from <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">classes</span></b> that can hold data and transform it in various ways. A class is a definition of the fundamental properties than an object has, while objects are specific examples of a class (for instance, the general idea of a dog is a class, while your pet dog would be an object.) <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Inheritance</span></b> allows subclasses to be defined so that the properties of a parent class are present in the sub-class (for example, \u201cschnauzer\u201d might be a subclass of \u201cdog\u201d). In <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">composition</span></b>, an object contains or references another object (which might or might not be of the same class, e.g., a dog\u2019s digestive system might be another object). Object-oriented programming also often uses <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">encapsulation</span></b> to hide unnecessary details from other aspects, e.g., a dog\u2019s digestive system doesn\u2019t need to know about its circulatory system. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Polymorphism</span></b> is the idea that different classes may be able to do the same things in potentially different ways, e.g., animals all eat but they do so in different ways. Java and C++ are object-oriented languages.</li>\n<li><b><span class=\"label\">Functional programming</span></b> is a paradigm based on the execution of various functions to calculate values. Functions in pure functional programming are free of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">side effects</span></b>, meaning that they do not change the program state but only compute values. Functional languages use <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">currying</span></b> to evaluate functions with multiple inputs. <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">ML</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Haskell</span></b> are functional programming languages.</li>\n<li>A <b><span class=\"label\">compiler</span></b> is used with many programming languages to convert human-readable code into instructions that a machine can execute. C and C++ programs are often compiled by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">GCC</span></b> into code specific for the machine the compiler is running on. Java\u2019s compiler instead compiles into a less specific format called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">bytecode</span></b>, which is executed by the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Java Virtual Machine</span></b> (JVM). Since compiled Java can be run on any machine with a JVM, Java is referred to as \u201cwrite once, run anywhere.\u201d Some languages are not compiled before running but instead have their code turned into machine instructions as they run, such as JavaScript and Python; these languages are called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">interpreted</span></b>.</li>\n<li>\n<p>A language\u2019s <b><span class=\"label\">typing</span></b> refers to how the type of data a variable holds is defined and can or can\u2019t change. Common types of variables are <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">booleans</span></b>, which can only be true or false; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">strings</span></b>, which hold text; <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">integers</span></b>; and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">floats</span></b> and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">doubles</span></b>, which hold non-integer numbers.</p>\n<p>In <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">statically typed languages</span></b>, a variable is given a type the first time it is used and can\u2019t be changed; compilers check that all variables have the correct types while the program is compiling, which helps catch errors but also makes some tasks more difficult. Java, C, and C++ have static typing.</p>\n<p><b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Dynamically typed languages</span></b> do not check types when compiling, which makes some tasks easier, but type errors (e.g., trying to multiply two strings) can occur while the program is running. Python and JavaScript are dynamically typed.</p>\n<p>Some languages support <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">duck typing</span></b>, which is sort of intermediate between static and dynamic typing. Duck typing essentially allows objects to do the same or similar things even if their classes have no formal relation. For example, airplanes and birds might both have a \u201cfly\u201d capability even though neither is a subclass of the other (or otherwise related).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>"

                "<li>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Polynomials</span></b> are functions made of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">terms</span></b> added together, in which each term is a number times a product of variables raised to nonnegative-integer powers.  For instance, 3<i>x</i><sup>2</sup><i>y</i> and \u2013\u03c0<i>x</i><sup>7</sup><i>y</i><sup>2</sup><i>z</i><sup>3</sup> are each terms, so 3<i>x</i><sup>2</sup><i>y</i>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u03c0<i>x</i><sup>7</sup><i>y</i><sup>2</sup><i>z</i><sup>3</sup> is a polynomial.  (Individual terms are also considered polynomials.)  Much of math is concerned with polynomials involving only one variable, such as \u2013<i>x</i><sup>3</sup>\u00a0+\u00a02<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>.  The number at the beginning of each term is called a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">coefficient</span></b>.</p>\n<p>Since simple numbers (\u201cconstants\u201d) can also be written as the same number times any variable to the zeroth power (that is, 6 is the same as 6<i>x</i><sup>0</sup>), numbers are also considered terms and polynomials.  So <i>x</i>\u00a0+\u00a06 is a polynomial, as is just \u20134.</p>\n<p>Polynomials can be classified according to their number of terms: a polynomial with one term, like 2<i>x</i> or \u201312<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, is called a <b><span class=\"label\">monomial</span></b>; a polynomial with two terms is called a <b><span class=\"label\">binomial</span></b>; and a polynomial with three terms is called a <b><span class=\"label\">trinomial</span></b>.</p>\n<p>Each polynomial has a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">degree</span></b>.  For polynomials of one variable, the degree is the largest exponent on the variable, so for the polynomial 4<i>x</i><sup>3</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, the degree is 3.  For polynomials of multiple variables, to find the degree you calculate the sum of the variables\u2019 exponents on each term, then choose the largest such sum, so the degree of 3<i>x</i><sup>6</sup><i>y</i><sup>5</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0<i>x</i><sup>2</sup><i>y</i><sup>3</sup> is calculated by adding 6+5\u00a0=\u00a011 for the first term and 2+3\u00a0=\u00a05 for the second and noting that 11 is larger, so the degree is 11.  A polynomial that is just a constant has degree 0.  A polynomial with degree 1, like 3<i>x</i>, is called <b><span class=\"label\">linear</span></b>; a polynomial with degree 2, like 3<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a08x\u00a0+\u00a04, is called <b><span class=\"label\">quadratic</span></b>; a polynomial with degree 3 is called <b><span class=\"label\">cubic</span></b>; continuing with increasing degrees, the terms are <b><span class=\"label\">quartic</span></b>, <b><span class=\"label\">quintic</span></b>, <b><span class=\"label\">sextic</span></b>, and so on, though terms corresponding to degrees larger than 5 are seldom used.  For technical reasons that are beyond the scope of this article, the zero polynomial (i.e., <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a00) is said to have a degree of \u2013\u221e or an undefined degree.</p>\n<p>The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">fundamental theorem of algebra</span></b> is the statement that every single-variable polynomial, other than constants, has a root in the complex numbers, which means that if <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) is a polynomial, then the equation <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a00 has at least one solution where <i>x</i> is some complex number.</p>\n<p>There are formulas to find those roots for linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic polynomials, though the latter two formulas are extremely complicated.  The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Abel-Ruffini theorem</span></b>, also called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Abel\u2019s impossibility theorem</span></b>, is the statement that there is no way to find a formula for the solutions of all quintic or higher-degree polynomials, if the formula must be based on the traditional operations (addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, and exponentiation/taking roots).  That impossibility is the topic that began an area of study called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Galois <b><span class=\"pg\">gal-wah</span></b> theory</span></b>, which is part of abstract algebra.</p>\n</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Quadratics</span></b> are, as mentioned above, polynomials of degree 2.  The graph of a quadratic equation will be in the shape of a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">parabola</span></b> that opens straight up (if the coefficient on the <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> term is positive) or straight down (if that coefficient is negative).  It is possible to find the roots of a quadratic by graphing it, factoring it, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">completing the square</span></b> on it, or using the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">quadratic formula</span></b> (itself derived by completing the square) on it.  If the quadratic is in the form <i>a</i><i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0+\u00a0<i>b</i><i>x</i>\u00a0+\u00a0<i>c</i>, then the expression <i>b</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a04<i>a</i><i>c</i>, which appears in the quadratic formula, is called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">discriminant</span></b>.  If the discriminant is positive, the quadratic will have two real roots; if the discriminant is zero, the quadratic will have one real root (said to have a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">multiplicity</span></b> of 2); and if the discriminant is negative, the quadratic will have two non-real complex roots (and if the coefficients of the quadratic are real numbers, the complex roots will be <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">conjugates</span></b> of each other).</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Rational functions</span></b> consist of one polynomial divided by another polynomial.  The denominator polynomial cannot be the zero polynomial, because dividing by zero is undefined. Examples therefore include 1/<i>x</i>, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>/(<i>x</i>\u00a0\u2013\u00a03), and (<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0+\u00a01)/(<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2013\u00a01).  Every polynomial can be considered to be a rational function because 1 is a polynomial and dividing by 1 doesn\u2019t change an expression (so to consider the polynomial <i>x</i><sup>3</sup> as a rational function, think of it as <i>x</i><sup>3</sup>/1).  It is often instructive to study the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">asymptotes</span></b> of rational functions, which are places in which their graphs approach a line (or occasionally other shape), usually getting infinitely close to but not crossing it.  That analysis may require performing <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">long division</span></b> on the numerator and denominator polynomials to find their <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">greatest common factor</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Periodic functions</span></b> are those whose graph repeats a pattern (specifically, the graph has <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">translational symmetry</span></b>).  Technically speaking, a function of one variable <i>f</i> is periodic if <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>+<i>p</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) for every <i>x</i> in the domain of the function and some positive number <i>p</i>, which is called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">period</span></b>, because the graph repeats itself every <i>p</i>\u00a0units.  While the trigonometric functions are the periodic functions most commonly encountered by high school math students, some other functions like triangle waves are also periodic; in general, functions representing waves tend to be periodic.  A <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Fourier <b><span class=\"pg\">fur-ee-ay</span></b> series</span></b> is a way to rewrite (almost) any periodic function in terms of only sine and cosine functions.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">trigonometric functions</span></b> represent relations between angles and sides of triangles.  They are often illustrated using points and segments related to a circle of radius\u00a01 centered at the origin, called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">unit circle</span></b>.  By far the most commonly discussed trigonometric functions are the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sine</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cosine</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">tangent</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cosecant</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">secant</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cotangent</span></b> functions.  There are <i>many</i> interesting relationships between these: the graphs of sine and cosine are translations of each other; the tangent function equals the sine function divided by the cosine function; the cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions are the reciprocals of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions, respectively; and there are many other relationships called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">trigonometric identities</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li>The <b><span class=\"label\">inverse trigonometric functions</span></b> are, as one might expect, the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">inverse functions</span></b> of the trigonometric functions.  (Note that \u201cinverse\u201d in this case refers to a function that \u201cundoes\u201d another, not to \u201cmultiplicative inverse,\u201d also called \u201creciprocal.\u201d)  They are sometimes just called \u201cinverse sine,\u201d etc, and are also given with the prefix \u201carc\u201d: <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arcsine</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arccosine</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arctangent</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arccosecant</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arcsecant</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">arccotangent</span></b>.  They are sometimes notated in the form sin<sup>\u20131</sup> for arcsine, but that notation can be confusing, so NAQT tends to prefer \u201carcsine,\u201d etc.  Because the trigonometric functions are not bijective (see below), to have inverses it is necessary to restrict the domains of the inverse trigonometric functions; for instance, arcsin(<i>x</i>) is only defined for <i>x</i> between \u20131 and 1, inclusive.</li>",
                "<li>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Injective functions</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"label\">injections</span></b>, are functions that do not repeat any outputs.  For instance, <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a02<i>x</i> is injective, because for every possible output value, there is only one input that will result in that output.  On the other hand, <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0sin(<i>x</i>) is <em>not</em> injective, because (for instance) the output 0 can be obtained from several different inputs (0, \u03c0, 2\u03c0, and so on).  If you have the graph of a function, you can determine whether the function is injective by applying the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">horizontal line test</span></b>:  if no horizontal line would ever intersect the graph twice, the function is injective.</p>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Surjective functions</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"label\">surjections</span></b>, are functions that achieve every possible output.  For instance, if you are thinking of functions whose domain and codomain are both the set of all real numbers, then <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0tan(<i>x</i>) is surjective, because every real number is an output for some input.  But <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> is not surjective, because (for instance) \u20133 is not an output for any real-number input.  The term <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">image</span></b> is sometimes used for the set of all output values that a function actually achieves; a surjective function, then, is one whose image equals its codomain.</p>\n<p>A function that is both injective and surjective is called <b><span class=\"label\">bijective</span></b>, or a <b><span class=\"label\">bijection</span></b>.  If a function is bijective, then it has an <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">inverse</span></b>.  Furthermore, a function can <em>only</em> have an inverse if it is bijective.</p>\n</li>",
                "<li>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Even functions</span></b> satisfy the rule <i>f</i>(\u2013<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) for every <i>x</i> in the domain of the function.  The graph of an even function has reflection symmetry over the <i>y</i>-axis.  Even functions are so named because if a polynomial\u2019s exponents (on the variable) are all even, then the polynomial is an even function; for instance, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, 3<i>x</i><sup>6</sup>, and \u2013<i>x</i><sup>8</sup>\u00a0+\u00a07<i>x</i><sup>4</sup> are all even.  There are other even functions, though, such as the cosine and absolute value functions.</p>\n<p><b><span class=\"label\">Odd functions</span></b> satisfy the rule <i>f</i>(\u2013<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0\u2013<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) for every <i>x</i> in the domain of the function.  The graph of an odd function remains the same when it is rotated 180\u00b0 around the origin.  Odd functions are so named because if a polynomial\u2019s exponents (on the variable) are all odd, then the polynomial is an odd function; for instance, <i>x</i><sup>3</sup>, 4<i>x</i><sup>7</sup>, and \u2013<i>x</i><sup>5</sup>\u00a0+\u00a02<i>x</i><sup>3</sup> are all odd.  There are other odd functions, such as the sine and cube root functions.</p>\n<p>Many functions are neither even nor odd, such as <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0+\u00a0<i>x</i>.  Only one function is both even and odd: the zero function, <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a00.</p>\n</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Exponential functions</span></b> are those of the form <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0<i>b</i><sup><i>x</i></sup>, where <i>b</i> (called the base) is a positive number other than 1. Exponential functions are used to model unrestricted <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">growth</span></b> (such as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">compound interest</span></b>, and animal <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">populations</span></b> with unlimited food and no predators) and <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">decay</span></b> (such as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">radioactive decay</span></b>).  The phrase \u201c<em>the</em> exponential function\u201d refers to the function <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0<i>e</i><sup><i>x</i></sup>, where <i>e</i> is a specific irrational number called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Euler\u2019s number</span></b>, about equal to 2.718.  Exponential functions have the interesting property that their <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">derivatives</span></b> are proportional to themselves.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Logarithmic functions</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"label\">logarithms</span></b>, are functions of the form <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0log<sub><i>b</i></sub><i>x</i>, where <i>b</i> is again a positive number other than 1 (and again called the base).  They are the inverses of the exponential functions with the same bases.  Logarithmic functions are used to model <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">sensory perception</span></b> and some phenomena in probability and statistics.  The phrase \u201c<em>the</em> logarithm\u201d can refer to a logarithmic function using the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">base\u00a02</span></b> (especially in computer science; this is also called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">binary logarithm</span></b>), <i>e</i> (especially in higher math), or 10 (especially in lower levels of math and physical sciences). The phrase <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">natural logarithm</span></b> refers to the logarithm base\u00a0<i>e</i>, and the phrase <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">common logarithm</span></b> usually refers to the logarithm base\u00a010.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Continuous functions</span></b>, studied in calculus, are functions where the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">limit</span></b> approaching each point equals the function\u2019s value at that point.  In particular, there are no <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">holes</span></b>, <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">jumps</span></b>, or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">asymptotes</span></b> \u201cin the middle of the graph.\u201d  Continuity is really a property of a specific point; a continuous function is a function that is continuous at every point.  Continuity is often explained as a function\u2019s graph being drawable in one motion without lifting the writing utensil from the paper.  All polynomials are continuous, as are the sine and cosine functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">absolute value function</span></b>.  Some examples of non-continuous functions are many rational functions, as they often have holes or asymptotes; the tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions, which have asymptotes; and the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">floor and ceiling functions</span></b>, which have jumps.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Differentiable functions</span></b>, also studied in calculus, are functions for which the derivative can be found (because a particular limit, called a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">difference quotient</span></b>, exists).  Like continuity, differentiability is really a property of a specific point, and a differentiable function is one that is differentiable at every point.  Every differentiable function is continuous, but some continuous functions are not differentiable; mathematicians thus say that differentiability is a stronger property than continuity.  In terms of graphs, a differentiable function has a \u201csmooth\u201d graph with no <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">corners</span></b> or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">cusps</span></b> (and also, because continuity is required, no holes, jumps, or asymptotes).  All polynomials are differentiable, as are the sine and cosine functions, and exponential and logarithmic functions.  However, the absolute value function <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)\u00a0=\u00a0|<i>x</i>| is not differentiable because it has a \u201ccorner\u201d at <i>x</i>\u00a0=\u00a00 (but recall that it is still continuous).</li>"

For example, the limit of 1/<i>x</i> as <i>x</i> gets infinity large (\u201capproaches infinity\u201d) is 0, even though the function never actually reaches 0. The definition of a limit is formalized in a way traditionally written with the Greek letters <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">epsilon and delta</span></b>, a technique developed by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Augustin-Louis Cauchy</span></b>.</li>",

Properly, a function is continuous at a given point if the function has a limit at that point and is <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">equal to its limit</span></b> there. It is also common to speak of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201ccontinuous functions,\u201d</span></b> which are functions that are continuous at every point. Polynomials are continuous, as are exponential and logarithmic functions, sine, and cosine. However, the other four trigonometric functions (cosecant, secant, tangent, and cotangent) are not continuous at some points (the ones at which their graphs have asymptotes), and rational functions generally have some points of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">discontinuity</span></b>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The derivative</span></b> is an operation that takes a function and results in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">another function</span></b> that gives the original function\u2019s <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">rate of change</span></b>. Taking a derivative is called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">differentiation</span></b> and is carried out with respect to the input variable that is changing. The derivative is calculated as the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">limit of a tangent line</span></b> between two points on the function\u2019s graph as the two points get arbitrarily close together. At any given point, the derivative\u2019s value is equal to the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">slope of the tangent line</span></b> to the function\u2019s graph at that point. The derivative of a function <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) is notated as <i>f</i>\u2032(<i>x</i>) (Lagrange\u2019s notation, pronounced \u201c<i>f</i> prime of <i>x</i>\u201d) or d<i>f</i>/d<i>x</i> (Leibniz notation, pronounced \u201cd <i>f</i> d <i>x</i>). Differentiation can be repeated, e.g,. differentiating a function twice gives its second derivative (<i>f</i>\u2032\u2032(<i>x</i>) or d\u00b2<i>f</i>/d<i>x</i>\u00b2).</li>",

The absolute value function is an example of a function that is differentiable in some places but not others: it is differentiable everywhere except at an input of 0, where its graph has a sharp <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">corner</span></b>. Differentiability is a stronger property than continuity: a function can only be differentiable if it is continuous, but it could be only continuous and not differentiable (the absolute value function being an example of that).

An integral is denoted by a \u201clong S\u201d symbol, \u222b.

For example, 80 = 2<sup>4</sup>\u00b75, and there is no other way to express 80 as a product of primes other than changing the order (80 = 5\u00b72<sup>4</sup> = 2<sup>3</sup>\u00b75\u00b72, etc., but these are all really the same product). This includes prime numbers as a \u201cproduct of just one prime,\u201d e.g., 7\u2019s prime factorization is just 7. This ubiquitous result in number theory is a principal reason that primes are so important.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">There are infinitely many prime numbers.</span></b> This is sometimes called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Euclid\u2019s theorem</span></b> since Euclid\u2019s <i class=\"ygk-term\">Elements</i> contained a proof of it similar to the following: Consider finitely many prime numbers <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>, \u2026 <i>p</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>. Now consider 1 more than the product of those prime numbers, that is, <i>p</i><sub>1</sub><i>p</i><sub>2</sub>\u00d7&amp;ctdot;\u00d7<i>p</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>\u2009+\u20091. That number cannot be divisible by any of the original prime numbers <i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>. Therefore, it must itself be prime, or else be divisible by prime numbers that are not on the original list. Either way, that means there is at least one prime number not on the original list. That argument can be applied to <em>any</em> finite list of prime numbers, so there cannot be any finite list that contains every prime number. There are many other proofs of this statement.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Fermat\u2019s little theorem</span></b> (not to be confused with Fermat\u2019s last theorem) states that if <i>p</i> is prime and <i>a</i> is any integer, then <i>a</i><sup><i>p</i></sup>\u00a0\u2261\u00a0<i>a</i>\u00a0mod\u2009<i>p</i>, that is, <i>a</i><sup><i>p</i></sup>\u2009\u2212\u2009<i>a</i> is divisible by <i>p</i>. This theorem is used in <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">probabilistic primality testing</span></b>, which is problematic because the converse is not always true: <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Carmichael numbers</span></b> (of which 561 is the smallest example) are composite numbers <i>n</i> such that if <i>a</i> is any integer, <i>a</i><sup><i>n</i></sup>\u00a0\u2261\u00a0<i>a</i>\u00a0mod\u2009<i>n</i>. Fermat\u0b01s little theorem can be generalized to composite numbers as <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Euler\u2019s theorem</span></b>, which uses <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Euler\u2019s totient function</span></b>.</li>",

Though named after the 18th-century English mathematician John Wilson, its first known use is by the 11th-century polymath Ibn\u00a0Al-Haytham. A common proof of the theorem requires the useful fact that each number from 1 to <i>p</i>\u2009\u2212\u20091 has a unique multiplicative inverse modulo\u00a0<i>p</i>.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Euclid\u2013Euler theorem</span></b> states that every <em>even</em> <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">perfect number</span></b> can be written in the form 2<sup><i>p</i>\u2009\u2212\u20091</sup>(2<sup><i>p</i></sup>\u2009\u2212\u20091), where <i>p</i> is prime. The latter factor is a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mersenne prime</span></b> (a prime number that is 1 less than a power of 2; the term <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Mersenne number</span></b> refers to any number 1 less than a power of 2, regardless of whether it is prime), and the theorem also states that every Mersenne prime gives rise to a perfect number via that formula, meaning that this formula gives a bijection between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes. (The theorem says nothing about odd perfect numbers, but it is not known whether any odd perfect numbers even exist.)</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The prime number theorem</span></b> describes the approximate behavior of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">prime counting function</span></b>, <i>\u03c0</i>(<i>n</i>), which gives the number of primes less than or equal to <i>n</i>. There is no exact straightforward formula for this function, but there are several approximations, including this theorem. Specifically, the prime number theorem says that <i>\u03c0</i>(<i>n</i>)\u00a0\uff5e\u00a0<i>n</i>\u2009/\u2009log<sub><i>e</i></sub><i>n</i>, that is, as <i>n</i> becomes arbitrarily large, <i>\u03c0</i>(<i>n</i>) gets arbitrarily close to <i>n</i>\u2009/\u2009log<sub><i>e</i></sub><i>n</i>. There are many alternate formulations of this theorem, including in terms of the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">logarithmic integral</span></b>.</li>",

Some cryptosystems use <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">safe primes</span></b>, which are primes that can be written in the form 2<i>p</i>\u2009+\u20091 for a smaller prime number <i>p</i>; these numbesr were first studied by Sophie Germain long before the advent of public key cryptography.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">Goldbach\u2019s conjecture</span></b>, sometimes called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">strong Goldbach conjecture</span></b>, is the unproven claim that every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. (For example, 16\u00a0=\u00a05\u2009+\u200911.) This has been verified from 4 to 4,000,000,000,000,000,000, but it has not been proven to be true for <em>every</em> even integer greater than 2. There are some interesting variations of this statement, such as that every odd integer greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three prime numbers, which is called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">weak Goldbach conjecture</span></b> and was proved by Harald Helfgott in 2013.</li>",
                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The Riemann hypothesis</span></b> is an unproven statement about the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Riemann zeta function</span></b>, <i>\u03b6</i>(<i>s</i>)\u00a0=\u00a01/1<sup><i>s</i></sup>\u2009+\u20091/2<sup><i>s</i></sup>\u2009+\u20091/3<sup><i>s</i></sup>\u2009+&amp;ctdot;, where <i>s</i> is a complex number. The hypothesis states that that function\u2019s zeroes (roots) are all either negative even numbers or complex numbers whose real part is \u00bd (the latter called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">critical strip</span></b> or <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">critical line</span></b>). The <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Euler product</span></b> is a technique that can be used to rewrite the zeta function as a product using prime numbers as indexes, which means the Riemann hypothesis has significant implications for how prime numbers are distributed, including for understanding how the approximation in the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">prime number theorem</span></b> changes its accuracy (called the <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">error term</span></b>). The zeta function and hypothesis were introduced by <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Bernhard Riemann</span></b> in 1859 in the paper <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">\u201cOn the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude.\u201d</span></b> Proving the hypothesis is a <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Millennium Prize Problem</span></b>.

                "<li><b><span class=\"label\">The twin prime conjecture</span></b> is the unproven statement that there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by 2, such as 3 and 5, or 101 and 103. These pairs are called <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">twin primes</span></b>. There has been rapid progress recently on the related concept of <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">prime gaps</span></b>, which are the differences between consecutive primes (e.g., 31 and 37 have a prime gap of 6, while twin primes have a prime gap of 2); the twin prime conjecture is equivalent to stating that a prime gap of 2 occurs infinitely often. In 2013 <b><span class=\"ygk-term\">Yitang Zhang</span></b> showed that there are infinitely many prime gaps less than 70\u00a0million; over the next two years, James Maynard and the collaborative Polymath project reduced this bound to 4860, 600, and 246.</li>"
